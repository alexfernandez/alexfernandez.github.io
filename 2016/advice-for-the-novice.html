<p>So you want to become a better developer? This <a href="becoming-a-better-developer.html">guide</a> is divided into four parts. The previous installment was about <a href="start-me-up.html">starting a career</a>, while the second (the one in your hands right now) is devoted to juniors wanted to improve in their careers.</p>
<p>Tips to help you improve are shown <strong>in bold</strong>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
Personal experiences will appear in colored boxes like this one.
</p>
<h2 id="life-as-a-junior">Life As A Junior</h2>
<p>So you are starting in our noble and worthy profession. What do you need to know to survive?</p>
<p>If you are a junior developer at a company, you want to be sure that there are really good people you can learn from. Most importantly, you want to actually learn from them. Ask to work with someone you respect.</p>
<p>Be prepared to receive criticism. It is not always easy to have someone rip through your code and be cool about it. Most people get emotional. Keep in mind that knowing what you are doing wrong is the best way to improve.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
My colleague Sergio García started as a junior at <a href="https://mediasmart.io/">mediasmart</a> at the same time I did; he had no professional experience. When I started commenting on his pull requests he probably felt that I hated him (and that I was a cold bastard); he got disheartened by all the negative feedback. Nowadays he takes criticism of his code as a pro!
</p>
<h2 id="learn-strategies">Learn Strategies</h2>
<p>While observing junior developers in the workplace, I realized that there was a crucial difference with their more senior peers. Faced with a hard problem, they tend to reach a point where they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have tried everything but it doesn't work. I don't know what is happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they give up. While more senior people <em>never</em> give up.</p>
<p>It helps a lot to know that <em>the problem has a solution</em>. All bugs can be detected and eventually corrected. It may lie in the place that you least expect, it may require lots of changes, but in the end you will solve it. Or someone else if you give up!</p>
<p><strong>Every bug has a fix, and it is within your grasp.</strong></p>
<p>As you learn to use more tools, you will have more arrows in your quiver, and this will help you try different approaches for problem solving. For instance, if you want to find and fix a bug, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow the code,</li>
<li>add traces to the code,</li>
<li>google any error messages,</li>
<li>use a debugger,</li>
<li>comment out parts of the code,</li>
<li>write an example that fails in a similar way,</li>
<li>google for people with the same problem,</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's a performance bug the strategies vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>add traces with time measurements,</li>
<li>profile the code,</li>
<li>isolate the slow part and benchmark it,</li>
<li>find a micro-benchmark with the same problem,</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. If you can't figure out a new strategy ask someone else.</p>
<p><strong>There is always another strategy to try out. Don't be discouraged.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ask-for-help">Ask For Help</h2>
<p>A junior asking continuously for help is not the worst that can happen. Oh no. Far worse is a junior <em>never asking for help</em>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
At <a href="https://mediasmart.io/">my current company</a> we are all busy people, so we tend to let juniors on their own, and &quot;let them float&quot;. This strategy does not always work. A big, strategic development was assigned to <a href="https://twitter.com/MandisBack">Fran Barea</a>, one of the junior engineers, to complement his work in tech support. The project did not progress as expected; in fact it missed all of its milestones. I offered help with it, and did a few joint design sessions. But still the junior engineer was overwhelmed, mostly by his tech support workload. After less than a year he was offered an attractive position at University and left. Since then, we try to keep a closer eye on juniors, and encourage them to ask for help.
</p>
<p><strong>Always ask for help if you feel lost.</strong></p>
<p>When asking for help, quite often you don't need someone to handhold you, or find the problem for you. Just asking what other strategy can be tried can be enough. And of course, do your homework before asking for help: try out the strategies that you know.</p>
<p><strong>Asking for help must be a last resource.</strong></p>
<h2 id="find-a-mentor">Find A Mentor</h2>
<p>You probably know someone who is a senior developer, and you may learn something from them. So, why not ask them to mentor you?</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I have had a few people ask me to mentor them over the last few years. I usually say yes, of course! However they seldom ask for anything. That is not how mentoring is supposed to work!
</p>
<p>A mentor is someone to ask questions to. Or at least to tell them your plans, and let them speak their opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Look for a good mentor, and then use them!</strong></p>
<p>By the way, you can contact me at <a href="alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com" class="uri">alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com</a>, if you need anything from me. I don't know if I'm senior, but at least I'm old.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Life as a junior can be hard, but if you work hard it can also be very rewarding.</p>
