So you want to become a better developer?
No matter what your current status is,
this simple guide will give you a few tips to help you improve.

I will include my personal experiences in colored boxes like this one,
just so you know where I am coming from.

## Advice For The Novice

### Is Attending University Worth It?

### Bootcamps

## Get Ahead Of The Curve

Now let us consider intermediate developers:
you have been in the industry for a few years,

### So Are You Good Already?

According to a stupid popular notion,
one half of everything is below average.
This is only true if the quality can be measured,
and it follows a Gaussian distribution.
This distinction is not just a fine point:
many important variables follow highly skewed distributions.

Let me give you just one example.
Household income is one of these highly skewed quantities.
According to 
[a report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/532416/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2014-2015.pdf)
by the
[UK Department for Work and Pensions](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-199495-to-201415),

> In 2014/15 just under two-thirds of individuals had a household income less than the
> national mean average (Â£581 per week).

Perhaps developer quality is similarly skewed.
How can we measure developer quality?

### Distribution Of Good Developers

### Your "Comfort Zone"

> Why the #@&! would I want to leave my comfort zone?
Do these people even know what "comfort" means?

Instead of vague feely-goody sentences,
we may offer concrete advice.

Learn a new language.
Use a new framework for your next pet project.
Always keep learning.

### Find Your Specialty

You cannot be a top developer by just being a generalist.

### Get Involved In The Community

## Top Of The Cream Of The Crop

Now we come to the most delicate part.
So you are finally what we may call
"an excellent developer".

### Trust Me, I'm An Engineer

"Engineer" is in many countries a prestigious title,
[derived](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engineer#Etymology)
from latin _ingenium_ (cleverness).

* A **programmer** is tasked with writing a program,
supposedly starting with a detailed specification.
* A **developer** has wider responsibilities:
create a software system that solves a certain problem.
* An **engineer** is tasked with devising a solution to a necessity.

### Bring Me Problems, Not Solutions

Quite often engineers are characterized as problem-solvers:
bring me a problem and I will give you a solution.
But that is not how a real-world engineer usually operates.
Once you find the problem it usually easy to solve it.
The real challenge is in finding the problem.

Oh, somebody may come with a high-level business target.
For old-school engineers the business target might be:
let the people of this town cross this river,
or accomodate the incoming traffic for the next 20 years.
For a software engineer it can be:
keep costs below a certain mark,
or connect to a server within a latency number.

### The Myth Of The 10x Engineer

### Let The World Know

Go give talks around.
Just send proposals to conferences.
It is a great way to attend amazing events for free!

### Be Ready to Resharpen Your Skills

Even if you are at the top of the game,
in our industry there are no guarantees.

<font color="#303">
About five years ago I left my job at ING Direct Spain
after four years as a project manager.
At that point I [co-founded a startup](http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/mib-five-years-later.html)
that ultimately went nowhere,
but allowed me to recycle myself starting to program again.

Just look at what the tech landscape looked like five years ago.
In 2011 containers were the realm of VMWare:
Docker did not exist,
and Linux developers were busy merging container-related patches into the kernel.
Internet Explorer was the
[most used browser globally](http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201101-201112),
and Chrome was just overtaking Firefox in the second place.
Mobile OSs were far below desktop operating systems:
both iOS and Android were below Mac OS in
[browser stats](http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201101-201112).
HTML5 was [being finalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#2011.C2.A0.E2.80.93_Last_Call)
and was not yet a recommended standard.
Node.js was at
[version 0.6.0](https://blog.risingstack.com/history-of-node-js/).
Meanwhile [Java 7 was just released](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29#Versions)
but not widely adopted
(and [Oracle had just bought Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle) a year ago).

### Teach Others

There is a reason why a very accomplished professional is called a
["master"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/master#Etymology_1),
which also happens to mean "teacher".
This goes beyond an Occidental tradition.
In martial arts movies great experts always have their own schools.

## Conclusion

No matter where you stand in your profession,
you can always get better.
