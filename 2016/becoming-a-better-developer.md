So you want to become a better developer?
No matter what your current status is,
this guide will give you a few tips to help you improve,
shown **in bold**.

Now, instead of a bland set of recommendations we have all read 1000 times by now,
I will try to make original points backed by data,
or at least by my own experience.

<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I will include my personal experiences in colored boxes like this one,
quite often extracted from
[my current company](https://mediasmart.io/).

## Contents

This series started life as a looong article,
so I have divided it into four parts,
from less to more experienced.

* Part 1: [Start Me Up](start-me-up.html).
* Part 2: [Advice For The Novice](advice-for-the-novice.html).
* More parts coming out soon.

<div style="display:none">
* Part 3: [Get Ahead Of The Curve](get-ahead-of-the-curve.html).
* Part 4: [Top Of The Cream Of The Crop](top-of-the-cream-of-the-crop.html).
</div>

### TL;DR

If you want a quick fix,
take a look at
[my presentation for Developers.nl](http://slides.com/alexfernandez/better-dev#/).
