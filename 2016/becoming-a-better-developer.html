<p>So you want to become a better developer? No matter what your current status is, this guide will give you a few tips to help you improve, shown <strong>in bold</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, instead of a bland set of recommendations we have all read 1000 times by now, I will try to back up my arguments with data. Or at least with my own experience.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I will include my personal experiences in colored boxes like this one.

<h2 id="start-me-up">Start Me Up</h2>
<p>You or maybe haven't even started yet but want to get in for the fame and riches.</p>
<h3 id="is-attending-university-worth-it">Is Attending University Worth It?</h3>
<p>The profession of software developer here in Spain is taught in &quot;ingeniería informática&quot;, which is an adaptation of the french term <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9nie_informatique">&quot;ingénierie informatique&quot;</a>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I studied physics, under the notion that I could learn how to program by myself, but I would never get to learn science properly if I studied computers. I believe I was basically right: it was one of the few good decisions I made as a teenager. I don't think that studying software engineering is useless; it's probably fine for most people.
</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing debate in Spain for many years about unauthorized practice in software engineering. Here is <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/sobre-intrusismo-profesional.html">my take (in Spanish)</a>. I have always wondered how you would forbid other people from developing software. Apparently software engineers want the exclusive right to sign software projects.</p>
<p>Many fine developers have just studied secondary school, and maybe earned a title in vocational education and training.</p>
<h3 id="bootcamps">Bootcamps</h3>
<p>It is a great day for software development: our skills are in such high demand that many cool companies are willing to take in people that have learned the basics of our profession in about 8 weeks. They are not cheap though.</p>
<p>They are not just for outsiders. I have met quite a few people that were already working as developers, and just wanted to recycle themselves.</p>
<h3 id="getting-that-job">Getting That Job</h3>
<p>So you have decided you want a job. How can you get it? Julia Grace, engineering director at Slack, <a href="http://www.juliahgrace.com/blog/2015/4/9/an-unconventional-guide-for-getting-a-software-engineering-job">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] find someone at the company (search their About pages, which often have links to employees’ LinkedIn, Twitter accounts, etc.) and email that person asking about the company. I’m not saying you should harass them, just politely reach out, indicate you’re interested in the company, ask for advice on how to apply. Most people want to help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole article is very interesting as it reframes a lot of common points of view.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-the-novice">Advice For The Novice</h2>
<p>So you are starting in our noble and worthy profession,</p>
<h3 id="life-as-a-junior">Life As A Junior</h3>
<p>If you are a junior developer at a company, you want to be sure that there are really good people you can learn from. Most importantly, you want to actually learn from them.</p>
<h3 id="learn-strategies">Learn Strategies</h3>
<p>While observing junior developers in the workplace, I realized that there was a crucial difference with their more senior peers. Faced with a hard problem, they tend to reach a point where they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have tried everything but it doesn't work. I don't know what is happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they give up. While more senior people <em>never</em> give up.</p>
<p>It helps a lot to know that <strong>the problem has a solution</strong>. All bugs can be detected and eventually corrected. It may lie in the place that you least expect, it may require lots of changes, but in the end you will solve it. Or someone else if you give up!</p>
<h2 id="ahead-of-the-curve">Ahead Of The Curve</h2>
<p>Now let us consider the next step. You have been in the industry for a few years,</p>
<h3 id="so-are-you-good-already">So Are You Good Already?</h3>
<p>According to a popular notion, one half of everything is below average. Wrong! This is only true if:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality can be measured,</li>
<li>and it follows a Gaussian distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second condition is not just a fine point: many important variables follow highly skewed distributions.</p>
<p>Let me give you just one example. Household income is one of these highly skewed quantities. According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/532416/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2014-2015.pdf">a report</a> by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-199495-to-201415">UK Department for Work and Pensions</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2014/15 just under two-thirds of individuals had a household income less than the national mean average (£581 per week).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps developer quality is similarly skewed. But what about the first condition? This brings us to an uncomfortable question: how can we measure developer quality?</p>
<h3 id="the-10x-engineer">The 10x Engineer</h3>
<p>Fred Brooks writes in the classic &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one of their studies, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant were measuring performances of a group of experienced programmers. Within just this group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0645438">the original study</a>.</p>
<p>DeMarco and Lister found huge differences in productivity in an inter-company competition.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>See how most people are below the average? Gradually people realized that there were huge differences in productivity between developers.</p>
<p>From this emerged the figure of the 10x engineer: a person which is able to do 10 times as much work as the regular developer.</p>
<h3 id="your-comfort-zone">Your &quot;Comfort Zone&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the #@&amp;! would I want to leave my comfort zone? Do these people even know what &quot;comfort&quot; means?</p>

<p>Instead of vague feely-goody sentences, we may offer concrete advice.</p>
<p>Learn a new language. Use a new framework for your next pet project. Always keep learning.</p>
<h3 id="find-your-specialty">Find Your Specialty</h3>
<p>You cannot be a top developer by just being a generalist.</p>
<h3 id="trust-me-im-an-engineer">Trust Me, I'm An Engineer</h3>
<p>&quot;Engineer&quot; is in many countries a prestigious title, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engineer#Etymology">derived</a> from latin <em>ingenium</em> (cleverness).</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>programmer</strong> is tasked with writing a program, supposedly starting with a detailed specification.</li>
<li>A <strong>developer</strong> has wider responsibilities: create a software system that solves a certain problem.</li>
<li>An <strong>engineer</strong> is tasked with devising a solution to a necessity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bring-me-problems-not-solutions">Bring Me Problems, Not Solutions</h3>
<p>Quite often engineers are characterized as problem-solvers: bring me a problem and I will give you a solution. But that is not how a real-world engineer usually operates. Once you find the problem it usually easy to solve it. The real challenge is in finding the problem.</p>
<p>Oh, somebody may come with a high-level business target. For old-school engineers the business target might be: let the people of this town cross this river, or accomodate the incoming traffic for the next 20 years. For a software engineer it can be: keep costs below a certain mark, or connect to a server within a latency number.</p>

<h2 id="top-of-the-cream-of-the-crop">Top Of The Cream Of The Crop</h2>
<p>Now we come to the most delicate part. So you are finally what we may call &quot;an excellent developer&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="the-myth-of-the-10x-engineer">The Myth Of The 10x Engineer</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/">huge controversy</a> surrounding the idea of 10x engineers. The problem is not with the findings themselves; those initial studies that we quoted above were complemented by <a href="http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Origins_of_10X_%E2%80%93_How_Valid_is_the_Underlying_Research_/">a few more</a>, and they all point to the same direction: there are 10x differences between the best and the worst developers.</p>
<p>No, the trouble lies in the new interpretation: that some engineers are <strong>10 times more productive than the average</strong>.</p>
<p>Many years ago, some people did a few programming tests, and found out that certain developers finished their assignments ten times faster than the average. From there a myth has been derived that says that certain engineers are ten times better than average.</p>
<p>In the words of Betsy Haibel in <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/hacker-mythologies-and-mismanagement">Hacker Mythologies and Mismanagement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="#the-myth-of-the-10x-engineer">The myth of the 10x engineer</a> plays to the hacker ego. Real True Hackers — the kind of Real True Hackers who think of themselves as some day inventing radically new tech — naturally identify themselves as 10x engineers amidst a sea of unimaginative clock-punching proles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The myth of the 10x engineer is derived from a game of telephone: a 1968 study by Sackman, Erikson, and Grant, briefly quoted in one chapter of Frederick Brooks’s The Mythical Man-Month. This study found order-of-magnitude differences in programmer productivity on some narrow measures, but was also methodologically flawed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a great article and I cannot recommend it more.</p>
<p>The most interesting point in Peopleware is not that some developers perform better than others, and it escapes most commentarists.</p>
<p>Their war games were done with couples of developers from the same company. The performance of both devs was highly correlated.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/demarcolisterteammates.gif" title="Teammates are highly correlated." alt="Correlation between teammates. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via Best Webfoot Forward." />

</div>
<p>But <em>they were not working together; rather competing one against the other</em>. The conclusions in <a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2007/02/16/demarco-and-lister/">the study that contains these scans</a> are interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over and over, I keep seeing that the median time to complete a single task is on the order of 2x to 4x times the fastest, not 100x. This study seems to imply that a great deal of that difference is due not to the individual’s inherent capabilities, but rather the environment where they work.</p>

<p>Even if you are at the top of the game, in our industry there are no guarantees.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
About five years ago I left my job at ING Direct Spain after four years as a project manager. At that point I <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/mib-five-years-later.html">co-founded a startup</a> that ultimately went nowhere, but allowed me to recycle myself starting to program again.
</p>
<p>Just look at what the tech landscape looked like five years ago. In 2011 containers were the realm of VMWare: Docker did not exist, and Linux developers were busy merging container-related patches into the kernel. Internet Explorer was the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201101-201112">most used browser globally</a>, and Chrome was just overtaking Firefox in the second place. Mobile OSs were far below desktop operating systems: both iOS and Android were below Mac OS in <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201101-201112">browser stats</a>. HTML5 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#2011.C2.A0.E2.80.93_Last_Call">being finalized</a> and was not yet a recommended standard. Node.js was at <a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/history-of-node-js/">version 0.6.0</a>. Meanwhile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29#Versions">Java 7 was just released</a> but not widely adopted (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">Oracle had just bought Sun</a> a year ago).</p>
<p>If you want to have a long and prosperous career you can either look for some obscure niche where there is no competition (think COBOL programmers today), or update your skills constantly.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories was of a mainframe programmer.</p>
<h3 id="let-the-world-know">Let The World Know</h3>
<p>Go give talks around. Just send proposals to conferences. It is a great way to attend amazing events for free!</p>
<h3 id="teach-others">Teach Others</h3>
<p>There is a reason why a very accomplished professional is called a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/master#Etymology_1">&quot;master&quot;</a>, which also happens to mean &quot;teacher&quot;. This goes beyond an Occidental tradition. In martial arts movies great experts always have their own schools.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No matter where you stand in your profession, you can always get better.</p>
