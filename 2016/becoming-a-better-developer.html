<h2 id="start-me-up">Start Me Up</h2>
<p>You want to try out the profession of software developer for the fame and riches. You have heard that recruiters are offering very well paid jobs, and that all of the cool girls and boys are working in the field. So how can you get in?</p>
<h3 id="vocation-and-devotion">Vocation And Devotion</h3>
<p>First let us do some soul-searching. Do you really want to spend your days (and some nights) crouched upon a computer keyboard, letting a screen (however large) be your only contact with the world? Do you have in you the will power to spend countless hours tracking a bug?</p>
<p>Software development is not an easy career to follow. Many people have found that there are other profitable career paths, some of them related to software development: marketing, UX design, sales.</p>
<h3 id="is-university-worth-it">Is University Worth It?</h3>
<p>There is a movement right now in software engineering</p>
<p>The profession of software developer here in Spain is taught in &quot;ingeniería informática&quot;, which is an adaptation of the french term <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9nie_informatique">&quot;ingénierie informatique&quot;</a>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I studied physics, under the notion that I could learn how to program by myself, but I would never get to learn science properly if I studied computers. I believe I was basically right: it was one of the few good decisions I made as a teenager. I don't think that studying software engineering is useless; it's probably fine for most people.
</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing debate in Spain for many years about unauthorized practice in software engineering. Here is <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/sobre-intrusismo-profesional.html">my take (in Spanish)</a>. I have always wondered how you would forbid other people from developing software. Apparently software engineers want the exclusive right to sign software projects.</p>
<p>Many fine developers have just studied secondary school, and maybe earned a title in vocational education and training.</p>
<h3 id="bootcamps">Bootcamps</h3>
<p>It is a great day for software development: our skills are in such high demand that many cool companies are willing to take in people that have learned the basics of our profession in about 8 weeks. They are not cheap though.</p>
<p>They are not just for outsiders. I have met quite a few people that were already working as developers, and just wanted to recycle themselves.</p>
<h3 id="getting-that-job">Getting That Job</h3>
<p>So you have decided you want a job. How can you get it? Julia Grace, engineering director at Slack, <a href="http://www.juliahgrace.com/blog/2015/4/9/an-unconventional-guide-for-getting-a-software-engineering-job">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] find someone at the company (search their About pages, which often have links to employees’ LinkedIn, Twitter accounts, etc.) and email that person asking about the company. I’m not saying you should harass them, just politely reach out, indicate you’re interested in the company, ask for advice on how to apply. Most people want to help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole article is very interesting as it reframes a lot of common points of view.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-the-novice">Advice For The Novice</h2>
<p>So you are starting in our noble and worthy profession,</p>
<h3 id="life-as-a-junior">Life As A Junior</h3>
<p>If you are a junior developer at a company, you want to be sure that there are really good people you can learn from. Most importantly, you want to actually learn from them. Ask to work with someone you respect.</p>
<h3 id="learn-strategies">Learn Strategies</h3>
<p>While observing junior developers in the workplace, I realized that there was a crucial difference with their more senior peers. Faced with a hard problem, they tend to reach a point where they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have tried everything but it doesn't work. I don't know what is happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they give up. While more senior people <em>never</em> give up.</p>
<p>It helps a lot to know that <em>the problem has a solution</em>. All bugs can be detected and eventually corrected. It may lie in the place that you least expect, it may require lots of changes, but in the end you will solve it. Or someone else if you give up!</p>
<p><strong>Every bug has a fix, and it is within your grasp.</strong></p>
<p>As you learn to use more tools, you will have more arrows in your quiver, and this will help you try different approaches for problem solving. For instance, if you want to find and fix a bug, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow the code,</li>
<li>add traces to the code,</li>
<li>google any error messages,</li>
<li>use a debugger,</li>
<li>comment out parts of the code,</li>
<li>write an example that fails in a similar way,</li>
<li>google for people with the same problem,</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's a performance bug the strategies vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>add traces with time measurements,</li>
<li>profile the code,</li>
<li>isolate the slow part and benchmark it,</li>
<li>find a micro-benchmark with the same problem,</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. If you can't figure out a new strategy ask someone else.</p>
<p><strong>There is always another strategy to try out. Don't be discouraged.</strong></p>
<h3 id="ask-for-help">Ask For Help</h3>
<p>A junior asking continuously for help is not the worst that can happen. Oh no. Far worse is a junior <em>never asking for help</em>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
At <a href="https://mediasmart.io/">my current company</a> we are all busy people, so we tend to let juniors on their own, and &quot;let them float&quot;. This strategy does not always work. A big, strategic development was assigned to <a href="https://twitter.com/MandisBack">Fran Barea</a>, one of the junior engineers, to complement his work in tech support. The project did not progress as expected; in fact it missed all of its milestones. I offered help with it, and did a few joint design sessions. But still the junior engineer was overwhelmed, mostly by his tech support workload. After less than a year he was offered an attractive position at University and left. Since then, we try to keep a closer eye on juniors, and encourage them to ask for help.
</p>
<p><strong>Always ask for help if you feel lost.</strong></p>
<h3 id="find-a-mentor">Find A Mentor</h3>
<p>You probably know someone who is a senior developer, and you may learn something from them. So, why not ask them to mentor you?</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I have had a few people ask me to mentor them over the last few years. I usually say yes, of course! However they seldom ask for anything. That is not how mentoring is supposed to work!
</p>
<p>A mentor is someone to ask questions to. Or at least to tell them your plans, and let them speak their opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Look for a good mentor, and then use them!</strong></p>
<p>By the way, you can contact me at <a href="alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com" class="uri">alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com</a>, if you need anything from me. I don't know if I'm senior, but at least I'm old.</p>
<h2 id="get-ahead-of-the-curve">Get Ahead Of The Curve</h2>
<p>Now let us consider the next step. You have been in the industry for a few years, you want to become a better developer.</p>
<h3 id="devotion">Devotion</h3>
<p>At this delicate juncture we must search our souls once more. Do you have the level of devotion needed to be, not just a regular software developer, but a really good one? Do you want to be at the top of your profession? Because honestly, you do not need to be: there are many people with an honest development job that are happy to punch a clock and do their time.</p>
<p>And then there are these people who do a lot of extra effort to look beyond what is asked from them, and learn new things every day.</p>
<p><strong>Never despise great developers; never despise good developers; never despise regular workers.</strong></p>
<p>I guess you can say it shorter: never despise other people for doing their work as best they can.</p>
<h3 id="impostor-syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</h3>
<p>Perhaps you think you are mediocre. Let me introduce you to this little concept called <a href="https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor">impostor syndrome</a>, which some say is <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html">not even a syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you feel you are not even average, you can improve a lot in your profession.</p>
<p><strong>Give a chance to mediocre people. Especially to yourself.</strong></p>
<h3 id="so-are-you-good-already">So Are You Good Already?</h3>
<p>According to a popular notion, one half of everything is below average. Wrong! This is only true if:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality can be measured,</li>
<li>and it follows a Gaussian distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us put aside the first condition for a moment. The second condition is not just a fine point: many important variables follow highly skewed distributions.</p>
<p>Let me give you just one example. Household income is one of these highly skewed quantities.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/income-median.png" title="Distribution is highly skewed to the left." alt="Income distribution in the UK (2014/15). Source: Households Below Average Income." />
<p class="caption">Income distribution in the UK (2014/15). Source: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/532416/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2014-2015.pdf">Households Below Average Income</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>According to the quoted report by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-199495-to-201415">UK Department for Work and Pensions</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2014/15 just under two-thirds of individuals had a household income less than the national mean average (£581 per week).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprise! Not one half below average, but two-thirds! Perhaps developer quality is similarly skewed.</p>
<p>Going back to the first condition brings us to an uncomfortable question: can we even measure developer quality?</p>
<h3 id="the-10x-engineer">The 10x Engineer</h3>
<p>Fred Brooks writes in the classic &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one of their studies, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant were measuring performances of a group of experienced programmers. Within just this group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0645438">the original study</a>.</p>
<p>DeMarco and Lister found huge differences in productivity in an inter-company competition.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/demarcolistertimetocomplete.gif" title="Minimum is 100 minutes, average 200, maximum 900." alt="Time to complete a programming task. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via Best Webfoot Forward." />
<p class="caption">Time to complete a programming task. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via <a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2007/02/16/demarco-and-lister/">Best Webfoot Forward</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>See how most people are below the average? Gradually people realized that there were huge differences in productivity between developers.</p>
<p>From this emerged the figure of the 10x engineer: a person which is able to do 10 times as much work as the regular developer.</p>
<h3 id="your-comfort-zone">Your &quot;Comfort Zone&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the #@&amp;! would I want to leave my comfort zone? Do these people even know what &quot;comfort&quot; means?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of vague feely-goody sentences, we may offer concrete advice.</p>
<p>Learn a new language. Use a new framework for your next pet project. Always keep learning.</p>
<h3 id="trust-me-im-an-engineer">Trust Me, I'm An Engineer</h3>
<p>&quot;Engineer&quot; is in many countries a prestigious title, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engineer#Etymology">derived</a> from latin <em>ingenium</em> (cleverness).</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>programmer</em> is tasked with writing a program, supposedly starting with a detailed specification.</li>
<li>A <em>developer</em> has wider responsibilities: create a software system that solves a certain problem.</li>
<li>An <em>engineer</em> is tasked with devising a solution to a necessity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all solutions involve developing software. As Ken Thompson <a href="http://quotes.cat-v.org/programming/">once said</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it is better to adapt an existing package, or just to hack up a simple console script that does 80% of what we want. And sometimes the best solution is to write some software. But always remember: writing software is a means to an end, not a goal in itself.</p>
<p><strong>Strive to create value, not just to write software.</strong></p>
<h3 id="bring-me-problems-not-solutions">Bring Me Problems, Not Solutions</h3>
<p>Quite often engineers are characterized as problem-solvers: bring me a problem and I will give you a solution. But that is not how a real-world engineer usually operates. Once you find the problem it usually easy to solve it. The real challenge is in finding the problem.</p>
<p>Oh, somebody may come with a high-level business target. For old-school engineers the business target might be: let the people of this town cross this river, or accomodate the incoming traffic for the next 20 years. For a software engineer it can be: keep costs below a certain mark, or connect to a server within a latency number.</p>
<p><strong>Do not wait for other people to give you problems; go after them for yourself.</strong></p>
<h3 id="find-your-specialty">Find Your Specialty</h3>
<p>You cannot be a top developer by just being a generalist. Luckily there are many disciplines inside software engineering UX, data science, security, scalability product owner, scrum master, stakeholder Gaming, devops, embedded, graphs, physics simulation, quality, mobile, machine learning, analytics.</p>
<p>Your knowledge should be T-shaped: a shallow familiarity with many disciplines,</p>
<h3 id="get-involved-in-the-community">Get Involved In The Community</h3>
<p>Finally, a really good way to improve as a software engineer is to find a local community, and get involved. Just showing up is a great first step!</p>
<p>The next step is to locate conferences, both at the national and international level, and go there.</p>
<p>Submit a proposal to a CfP (call for proposals).</p>
<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a great way to attend for free!</strong></p>
<p>Well, there's the unpaid time for preparing the talk. But you get the point.</p>
<h2 id="top-of-the-cream-of-the-crop">Top Of The Cream Of The Crop</h2>
<p>Now we come to the most delicate part. So you are finally what we may call &quot;an excellent developer&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="the-myth-of-the-10x-engineer">The Myth Of The 10x Engineer</h3>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/">huge controversy</a> surrounding the idea of 10x engineers. The problem is not with the findings themselves. The first study quoted by Fred Brooks had serious problems, for instance: they measured time for <em>debugging</em>, not time for <em>programming</em>. But those initial studies quoted above have been complemented by <a href="http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Origins_of_10X_%E2%80%93_How_Valid_is_the_Underlying_Research_/">a few more</a>, and they all point to the same direction: there are 10x differences between the best and the worst developers.</p>
<p>No, the trouble lies in the new interpretation: that some engineers are <em>10 times more productive than the average</em>. This is not upheld by any studies. Perhaps two or three times as productive? That is fine, and would be expected on any field. But from there to ten times is a long stretch.</p>
<p>In the words of Betsy Haibel in <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/hacker-mythologies-and-mismanagement">Hacker Mythologies and Mismanagement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="#the-myth-of-the-10x-engineer">The myth of the 10x engineer</a> plays to the hacker ego. Real True Hackers — the kind of Real True Hackers who think of themselves as some day inventing radically new tech — naturally identify themselves as 10x engineers amidst a sea of unimaginative clock-punching proles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a great article and I cannot recommend it more.</p>
<p>The most interesting point in Peopleware is not that some developers perform better than others, and it escapes most commentarists. Their war games were done with couples of developers from the same company. The performance of both devs was highly correlated.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/demarcolisterteammates.gif" title="Teammates are highly correlated." alt="Correlation between teammates. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via Best Webfoot Forward." />
<p class="caption">Correlation between teammates. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via <a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2007/02/16/demarco-and-lister/">Best Webfoot Forward</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>But <em>couples were not working together; they were rather competing one against the other</em>. The conclusions in <a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2007/02/16/demarco-and-lister/">the study that contains these scans</a> are interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over and over, I keep seeing that the median time to complete a single task is on the order of 2x to 4x times the fastest, not 100x. This study seems to imply that a great deal of that difference is due not to the individual’s inherent capabilities, but rather the environment where they work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice comes naturally from this refined argument about the &quot;3x engineer&quot;:</p>
<p><strong>Look for a company where your skills can really shine.</strong></p>
<p>This includes: comfortable working space, probably telecommuting at least part of the time, a comfortable environment where you can take risks, and great colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="look-for-help">Look For Help</h3>
<p>Another great point by <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/hacker-mythologies-and-mismanagement">Betsy Haibel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myths about 10x engineers are used to make employees feel guilty or incompetent when they ask co-workers for help; truly qualified engineers don’t need help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, this is not true. Even if you are the world's best engineer, there comes a time when you need to talk a problem over with someone. Not necessarily another senior developer: juniors and people with less experience have a lot to offer in the way of fresh perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>When faced with a big challenge, share it. Help may come from where you least expect it.</strong></p>
<p>Brainstorming sessions are great tools when used properly.</p>
<h3 id="be-ready-to-resharpen-your-skills">Be Ready to Resharpen Your Skills</h3>
<p>Even if you are at the top of the game, in our industry there are no guarantees.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
About five years ago I left my job at ING Direct Spain after four years as a project manager. At that point I <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/mib-five-years-later.html">co-founded a startup</a> that ultimately went nowhere, but allowed me to recycle myself starting to program again.
</p>
<p>Just look at what the tech landscape looked like five years ago. In 2011 containers were the realm of VMWare: Docker did not exist, and Linux developers were busy merging container-related patches into the kernel. Internet Explorer was the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201101-201112">most used browser globally</a>, and Chrome was just overtaking Firefox in the second place. Mobile OSs were far below desktop operating systems: both iOS and Android were below Mac OS in <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201101-201112">browser stats</a>. HTML5 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#2011.C2.A0.E2.80.93_Last_Call">being finalized</a> and was not yet a recommended standard. Node.js was at <a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/history-of-node-js/">version 0.6.0</a>. Meanwhile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29#Versions">Java 7 was just released</a> but not widely adopted (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">Oracle had just bought Sun</a> a year ago).</p>
<p>If you want to have a long and prosperous career you can either look for some obscure niche where there is no competition (think COBOL programmers today), or update your skills constantly.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories was of a mainframe programmer.</p>
<h3 id="let-the-world-know">Let The World Know</h3>
<p>Go give talks around. Just send proposals to conferences. It is a great way to attend amazing events for free!</p>
<h3 id="teach-others">Teach Others</h3>
<p>There is a reason why a very accomplished professional is called a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/master#Etymology_1">&quot;master&quot;</a>, which also happens to mean &quot;teacher&quot;. This goes beyond an Occidental tradition. In martial arts movies great experts always have their own schools.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No matter where you stand in your profession, you can always get better.</p>
