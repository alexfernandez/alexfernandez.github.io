<p>So you want to become a better developer? No matter what your current status is, this guide will give you a few tips to help you improve, shown <strong>in bold</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, instead of a bland set of recommendations we have all read 1000 times by now, I will try to back up my arguments with data. Or at least with my own experience.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I will include my personal experiences in colored boxes like this one.
</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<p>This is a looong article, so I suggest you go straight to the section you feel more identifed with, from less to more experienced.</p>

<h2 id="start-me-up">Start Me Up</h2>
<p>You want to try out the profession of software developer for the fame and riches. You have heard that recruiters are offering very well paid jobs, and that all of the cool girls and boys are working in the field. So how can you get in?</p>
<h3 id="vocation-and-devotion">Vocation And Devotion</h3>
<p>First let us do some soul-searching. Do you really want to spend your days (and some nights) crouched upon a computer keyboard, letting a screen (however large) be your only contact with the world? Do you have in you the will power to spend countless hours tracking a bug?</p>
<p>Software development is not an easy career to follow. Many people have found that there are other profitable career paths, some of them related to software development: marketing, UX design, sales.</p>
<h3 id="is-university-worth-it">Is University Worth It?</h3>
<p>There is a movement right now in software engineering</p>
<p>The profession of software developer here in Spain is taught in &quot;ingeniería informática&quot;, which is an adaptation of the french term <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9nie_informatique">&quot;ingénierie informatique&quot;</a>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I studied physics, under the notion that I could learn how to program by myself, but I would never get to learn science properly if I studied computers. I believe I was basically right: it was one of the few good decisions I made as a teenager. I don't think that studying software engineering is useless; it's probably fine for most people.
</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing debate in Spain for many years about unauthorized practice in software engineering. Here is <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/sobre-intrusismo-profesional.html">my take (in Spanish)</a>. I have always wondered how you would forbid other people from developing software. Apparently software engineers want the exclusive right to sign software projects.</p>
<p>Many fine developers have just studied secondary school, and maybe earned a title in vocational education and training.</p>
<h3 id="bootcamps">Bootcamps</h3>
<p>It is a great day for software development: our skills are in such high demand that many cool companies are willing to take in people that have learned the basics of our profession in about 8 weeks. They are not cheap though.</p>
<p>They are not just for outsiders. I have met quite a few people that were already working as developers, and just wanted to recycle themselves.</p>
<h3 id="pet-project"> Pet Project</h3>
<p>By far, the best way to learn a new language, framework or environment is doing a pet project using it. That way, the project supplies the motivation and you only need to fill in the details.</p>
<p>This is also a great presentation card for a prospective employer.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I was writing a book that never materialized, in an obscure editor called <a href="https://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a>. I started <a href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/elyxer">eLyXer</a> to help me convert it to HTML; it was very useful to learn Python. Later on I wrote <a href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/milliearth">milliearth</a>, and then <a href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest">loadtest</a>. I have learned a lot of Node.js with these two projects.
</p>
<h3 id="getting-that-job">Getting That Job</h3>
<p>So you have decided you want a job. How can you get it? Julia Grace, engineering director at Slack, <a href="http://www.juliahgrace.com/blog/2015/4/9/an-unconventional-guide-for-getting-a-software-engineering-job">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] find someone at the company (search their About pages, which often have links to employees’ LinkedIn, Twitter accounts, etc.) and email that person asking about the company. I’m not saying you should harass them, just politely reach out, indicate you’re interested in the company, ask for advice on how to apply. Most people want to help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole article is very interesting as it reframes a lot of common points of view.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-the-novice">Advice For The Novice</h2>
<p>So you are starting in our noble and worthy profession. What do you need to know to survive?</p>
<h3 id="life-as-a-junior">Life As A Junior</h3>
<p>If you are a junior developer at a company, you want to be sure that there are really good people you can learn from. Most importantly, you want to actually learn from them. Ask to work with someone you respect.</p>
<h3 id="learn-strategies">Learn Strategies</h3>
<p>While observing junior developers in the workplace, I realized that there was a crucial difference with their more senior peers. Faced with a hard problem, they tend to reach a point where they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have tried everything but it doesn't work. I don't know what is happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they give up. While more senior people <em>never</em> give up.</p>
<p>It helps a lot to know that <em>the problem has a solution</em>. All bugs can be detected and eventually corrected. It may lie in the place that you least expect, it may require lots of changes, but in the end you will solve it. Or someone else if you give up!</p>
<p><strong>Every bug has a fix, and it is within your grasp.</strong></p>
<p>As you learn to use more tools, you will have more arrows in your quiver, and this will help you try different approaches for problem solving. For instance, if you want to find and fix a bug, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow the code,</li>
<li>add traces to the code,</li>
<li>google any error messages,</li>
<li>use a debugger,</li>
<li>comment out parts of the code,</li>
<li>write an example that fails in a similar way,</li>
<li>google for people with the same problem,</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's a performance bug the strategies vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>add traces with time measurements,</li>
<li>profile the code,</li>
<li>isolate the slow part and benchmark it,</li>
<li>find a micro-benchmark with the same problem,</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. If you can't figure out a new strategy ask someone else.</p>
<p><strong>There is always another strategy to try out. Don't be discouraged.</strong></p>
<h3 id="ask-for-help">Ask For Help</h3>
<p>A junior asking continuously for help is not the worst that can happen. Oh no. Far worse is a junior <em>never asking for help</em>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
At <a href="https://mediasmart.io/">my current company</a> we are all busy people, so we tend to let juniors on their own, and &quot;let them float&quot;. This strategy does not always work. A big, strategic development was assigned to <a href="https://twitter.com/MandisBack">Fran Barea</a>, one of the junior engineers, to complement his work in tech support. The project did not progress as expected; in fact it missed all of its milestones. I offered help with it, and did a few joint design sessions. But still the junior engineer was overwhelmed, mostly by his tech support workload. After less than a year he was offered an attractive position at University and left. Since then, we try to keep a closer eye on juniors, and encourage them to ask for help.
</p>
<p><strong>Always ask for help if you feel lost.</strong></p>
<h3 id="find-a-mentor">Find A Mentor</h3>
<p>You probably know someone who is a senior developer, and you may learn something from them. So, why not ask them to mentor you?</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I have had a few people ask me to mentor them over the last few years. I usually say yes, of course! However they seldom ask for anything. That is not how mentoring is supposed to work!
</p>
<p>A mentor is someone to ask questions to. Or at least to tell them your plans, and let them speak their opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Look for a good mentor, and then use them!</strong></p>
<p>By the way, you can contact me at <a href="alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com" class="uri">alexfernandeznpm@gmail.com</a>, if you need anything from me. I don't know if I'm senior, but at least I'm old.</p>
<h2 id="get-ahead-of-the-curve">Get Ahead Of The Curve</h2>
<p>Now let us consider the next step. You have been in the industry for a few years, you want to become a better developer.</p>
<h3 id="devotion">Devotion</h3>
<p>At this delicate juncture we must search our souls once more. Do you have the level of devotion needed to be, not just a regular software developer, but a really good one? Do you want to be at the top of your profession? Because honestly, you do not need to be: there are many people with an honest development job that are happy to punch a clock and do their time.</p>
<p>And then there are these people who do a lot of extra effort to look beyond what is asked from them, and learn new things every day.</p>
<p><strong>Never despise great developers; never despise good developers; never despise regular workers.</strong></p>
<p>I guess you can say it shorter: never despise other people for doing their work as best they can.</p>
<h3 id="impostor-syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</h3>
<p>Perhaps you think you are mediocre. Let me introduce you to this little concept called <a href="https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor">impostor syndrome</a>, which some say is <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html">not even a syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>Basically it means that you feel that you are not adequate at your work, even though external measures say you should. It is often felt by people of all conditions, especially high achievers. Albert Einstein <a href="http://therebegiants.com/overcoming-impostor-syndrome/">famously said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exaggerated esteem in which my lifework is held makes me very ill at ease. I feel compelled to think of myself as an involuntary swindler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the most celebrated physicist in the 20th century was not immune to impostor syndrome, how can you expect to overcome it? I recommend focusing on two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you don't have to tell others how good or bad you <em>think</em> you are; just tell them what you have accomplished and let them draw their own conclusions. In time this will allow you to focus on results instead of on how good you are or are not.</li>
<li>And then you can just work hard. Don't give yourself a heart attack or spend your life on the keyboard; just do your best at whatever you do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, what if you really are mediocre? Even if you feel you are below average, you can improve a lot in our profession just by working hard and focusing on results.</p>
<p><strong>Give a chance to mediocre people. Especially to yourself.</strong></p>
<h3 id="so-are-you-good-already">So Are You Good Already?</h3>
<p>According to a popular notion, one half of everything is below average. Wrong! This is only true if:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality can be measured,</li>
<li>and it follows a Gaussian distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us put aside the first condition for a moment. The second condition is not just a fine point: many important variables follow highly skewed distributions.</p>
<p>Let me give you just one example. Household income is one of these highly skewed quantities.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/income-median.png" title="Distribution is highly skewed to the left." alt="Income distribution in the UK (2014/15). Source: Households Below Average Income." />
<p class="caption">Income distribution in the UK (2014/15). Source: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/532416/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2014-2015.pdf">Households Below Average Income</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>According to the quoted report by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-199495-to-201415">UK Department for Work and Pensions</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2014/15 just under two-thirds of individuals had a household income less than the national mean average (£581 per week).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprise! Not one half below average, but two-thirds! Perhaps developer quality is similarly skewed.</p>
<p>Going back to the first condition brings us to an uncomfortable question: can we even measure developer quality?</p>
<h3 id="the-10x-engineer">The 10x Engineer</h3>
<p>Fred Brooks writes in the classic &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one of their studies, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant were measuring performances of a group of experienced programmers. Within just this group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0645438">the original study</a>.</p>
<p>DeMarco and Lister found huge differences in productivity in an inter-company competition.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/demarcolistertimetocomplete.gif" title="Minimum is 100 minutes, average 200, maximum 900." alt="Time to complete a programming task. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via Best Webfoot Forward." />
<p class="caption">Time to complete a programming task. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via <a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2007/02/16/demarco-and-lister/">Best Webfoot Forward</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>See how most people are below the average? Gradually people realized that there were huge differences in productivity between developers.</p>
<p>From this emerged the figure of the 10x engineer: a person which is able to do 10 times as much work as the regular developer.</p>
<h3 id="your-comfort-zone">Your &quot;Comfort Zone&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the #@&amp;! would I want to leave my comfort zone? Do these people even know what &quot;comfort&quot; means?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translated from <a href="https://twitter.com/zezenzuska/status/639350587730100225?lang=es">@zezenzuska</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of vague feely-goody sentences, we may offer concrete advice.</p>
<p>Learn a new language. Use a new framework for your next pet project. Read books about your profession.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
A common request from workers at most companies I know is: &quot;we want more training&quot;. It has always amazed me: how come companies are not willing to train their workers? That is a cheap request to make; in exchange they would get a better and more motivated workforce. But quite often those requests are not met.
</p>
<p>If your company is not giving you training, look for it yourself. Get them to pay for interesting courses and conferences, or at least to give you time off so you can attend. If they don't, consider other jobs. But while you are there, consider taking holidays for these activities.</p>
<p><strong>Your career is your responsibility, not your company's.</strong></p>
<p>Always keep learning.</p>
<h3 id="trust-me-im-an-engineer">Trust Me, I'm An Engineer</h3>
<p>&quot;Engineer&quot; is in many countries a prestigious title, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engineer#Etymology">derived</a> from latin <em>ingenium</em> (cleverness).</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>programmer</em> is tasked with writing a program, supposedly starting with a detailed specification.</li>
<li>A <em>developer</em> has wider responsibilities: create a software system that solves a certain problem.</li>
<li>An <em>engineer</em> is tasked with devising a solution to a necessity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all solutions involve developing software. As Ken Thompson <a href="http://quotes.cat-v.org/programming/">once said</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it is better to adapt an existing package, or just to hack up a simple console script that does 80% of what we want. And sometimes the best solution is to write some software. But always remember: writing software is a means to an end, not a goal in itself.</p>
<p><strong>Strive to create value, not just to write software.</strong></p>
<h3 id="find-your-specialty">Find Your Specialty</h3>
<p>You cannot be a top developer by just being a generalist. Luckily there are many disciplines inside software engineering. A few of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>UX,</li>
<li>data science,</li>
<li>security,</li>
<li>scalability,</li>
<li>development methodology,</li>
<li>gaming,</li>
<li>DevOps,</li>
<li>embedded systems,</li>
<li>physics simulation,</li>
<li>visualization,</li>
<li>quality assurance,</li>
<li>mobile apps,</li>
<li>machine learning,</li>
<li>analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your knowledge should be T-shaped: a shallow familiarity with many disciplines, and deep understanding of one or two.</p>
<h3 id="get-involved-in-the-community">Get Involved In The Community</h3>
<p>Finally, a really good way to improve as a software engineer is to find a local community, and get involved. Just showing up is a great first step! Then you can try giving a talk there, and seeing if people like it.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
In 2013 I approached the organizers of MadridJS to propose a talk about Node.js and Websockets, something I had been working on in my spare time.
</p>
<p>It is very rewarding to know more people that work in your field, and exchange stories from the trenches.</p>
<p>The next step is to attend a few conferences, both at the national and international level. This way you can broaden your circle of acquaintances: most people are quite open at conferences and are usually willing to speak to anyone during breaks.</p>
<h2 id="top-of-the-cream-of-the-crop">Top Of The Cream Of The Crop</h2>
<p>Now we come to the most delicate part. So you are finally what we may call &quot;a good developer&quot;. How can you really shine?</p>
<h3 id="the-myth-of-the-10x-engineer">The Myth Of The 10x Engineer</h3>
<p>The idea of 10x engineers is alive and well, as shown in <a href="https://twitter.com/pinchito/status/779374657984159744">this informal Twitter poll</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/poll-10x-engineer.png" title="29% say &#39;More or less&#39;, 15% &#39;It&#39;s a myth&#39;, 12% &#39;TGIF, GTFO&#39;." alt="In a sample of 59 developers, 44% think that 10x engineers exist." />
<p class="caption">In a sample of 59 developers, 44% think that 10x engineers exist.</p>
</div>
<p>However, there is a <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/">huge controversy</a> surrounding the concept. The problem is not with the studies themselves. The first study quoted by Fred Brooks had serious problems, a very small sample to start with. But those initial studies quoted above have been complemented by <a href="http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Origins_of_10X_%E2%80%93_How_Valid_is_the_Underlying_Research_/">a few more</a>, and they all point to the same direction: there are 10x differences between the best and the worst developers.</p>
<p>No, the trouble lies in the new implicit interpretation: that some engineers are <em>10 times more productive than the average</em>. This is not upheld by any studies. Perhaps two or three times as productive? That is fine, and would be expected on any field. But from there to ten times is a long stretch.</p>
<p>In the words of Betsy Haibel in <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/hacker-mythologies-and-mismanagement">Hacker Mythologies and Mismanagement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="#the-myth-of-the-10x-engineer">The myth of the 10x engineer</a> plays to the hacker ego. Real True Hackers — the kind of Real True Hackers who think of themselves as some day inventing radically new tech — naturally identify themselves as 10x engineers amidst a sea of unimaginative clock-punching proles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a great article and I cannot recommend it more.</p>
<p>The most interesting point in Peopleware is not that some developers perform better than others. There is a deep conclusion in there that eludes most commentarists. Their war games were done with couples of developers from the same company. The performance of both devs in each team was highly correlated.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/demarcolisterteammates.gif" title="Teammates are highly correlated." alt="Correlation between teammates. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via Best Webfoot Forward." />
<p class="caption">Correlation between teammates. Source: DeMarco and Lister: Peopleware (2nd edition), 1999, via <a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2007/02/16/demarco-and-lister/">Best Webfoot Forward</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>But <em>couples in a team were not working together; they were rather competing one against the other</em>. The conclusions in <a href="http://blog.webfoot.com/2007/02/16/demarco-and-lister/">the study that contains these scans</a> are interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over and over, I keep seeing that the median time to complete a single task is on the order of 2x to 4x times the fastest, not 100x. This study seems to imply that a great deal of that difference is due not to the individual’s inherent capabilities, but rather the environment where they work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice comes naturally from this refined argument about the &quot;3x engineer&quot;:</p>
<p><strong>Look for a company where your skills can really shine.</strong></p>
<p>This includes: comfortable working space, probably telecommuting at least part of the time, a comfortable environment where you can take risks, and great colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="bring-me-problems-not-solutions">Bring Me Problems, Not Solutions</h3>
<p>Quite often engineers are characterized as problem-solvers: bring me a problem and I will give you a solution. But that is not how a real-world engineer usually operates. Once you find the problem it usually easy to solve it. The real challenge is in finding the problem.</p>
<p>Oh, somebody may come with a high-level business target. For old-school engineers the business target might be: let the people of this town cross this river, or accomodate the incoming traffic for the next 20 years. For a software engineer it can be: keep costs below a certain mark, or connect to a server within a latency number.</p>
<p><strong>Do not wait for other people to give you problems; go after them for yourself.</strong></p>
<h3 id="look-for-help">Look For Help</h3>
<p>Another great point by Betsy Haibel in <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/hacker-mythologies-and-mismanagement">the article quoted above</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myths about 10x engineers are used to make employees feel guilty or incompetent when they ask co-workers for help; truly qualified engineers don’t need help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, this is not true. Even if you are the world's best engineer, there comes a time when you need to talk a problem over with someone. Not necessarily another senior developer: juniors and people with less experience have a lot to offer in the way of fresh perspectives.</p>

About five years ago I left my job at ING Direct Spain after four years as a project manager. At that point I <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/mib-five-years-later.html">co-founded a startup</a> that ultimately went nowhere, but allowed me to recycle myself starting to program again.
</p>
<p>Just look at what the tech landscape looked like five years ago. In 2011 containers were the realm of VMWare: Docker did not exist, and Linux developers were busy merging container-related patches into the kernel. Internet Explorer was the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201101-201112">most used browser globally</a>, and Chrome was just overtaking Firefox in the second place. Mobile OSs were far below desktop operating systems: both iOS and Android were below Mac OS in <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201101-201112">browser stats</a>. HTML5 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#2011.C2.A0.E2.80.93_Last_Call">being finalized</a> and was not yet a recommended standard. Node.js was at <a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/history-of-node-js/">version 0.6.0</a>. Meanwhile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29#Versions">Java 7 was just released</a> but not widely adopted (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">Oracle had just bought Sun</a> a year ago).</p>
<p>If you want to have a long and prosperous career you can either look for some obscure niche where there is no competition (think COBOL programmers today), or update your skills constantly.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories was of a mainframe programmer.</p>
<h3 id="let-the-world-know">Let The World Know</h3>
<p>Conferences all around the world are eager to hear from people of all backgrounds. Why not speak about some interesting project at one? Just send proposals to a few CfPs (calls for proposals). It is a great way to attend amazing events for free!</p>
<p>There are a few places that track such calls, such as <a href="http://lanyrd.com/calls/">Lanyrd.com</a>. Just be sure to speak at a <a href="#get-involved-in-the-community">local community first</a>, then work your way up to national and then international conferences when you feel comfortable. Speaking at conferences is a great way to attend for free! Well, there's the unpaid time for preparing the talk, so your ticket does not really come for &quot;free&quot;. But you get the point.</p>
<p>The benefits go beyond attending conferences and meeting interesting people in the speakers dinner.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
My first talk at a local community was a great attendance success at MadridJS, since it was about a hot topic at the moment: Node.js and Websockets. It was <a href="https://vimeo.com/62771422">unfortunately taped (in Spanish)</a>. You can see how nervous I was. But I persevered: less than a year after that, I gave an <a href="https://vimeo.com/121892726">international talk</a>, and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/pinchito/sessions/">kept at it</a>. Gradually I became better at it. Right now I feel much more confident when presenting to prospective investors, or selling a project to the CEO.
</p>
<p>When you can speak in public with confidence, it becomes much easier to do a presentation in front of a small group.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a great way to learn how to speak in public.</strong></p>
<h3 id="sell-your-work">Sell Your Work</h3>
<p>Maybe you dislike the phrase above: &quot;selling a project to the CEO&quot;. Well, otherwise how do you expect others to buy your ideas?</p>
<p>Perhaps you remember the famous sentence from Glengarry Glen Ross: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMFwFgG9NE8">&quot;Coffee is for closers only&quot;</a>. It is interesting that a movie that tried to show the inhumanity of salespeople has become famed among their profession. But we are not trying to sell real estate here, and we don't want to use hardball tactics.</p>
<p>It is no good to make a fast sale and lose a customer. We are in for the long run. When making a deal, keep in mind that in good deals both parties benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Always sell your work ethically and truthfully.</strong></p>
<p>But do sell it.</p>
<h3 id="teach-others">Teach Others</h3>
<p>There is a reason why a very accomplished professional is called a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/master#Etymology_1">&quot;master&quot;</a>, which also happens to mean &quot;teacher&quot;. This goes beyond an Occidental tradition. In martial arts movies great experts always have their own schools.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No matter where you stand in your profession, you can always get better. It just takes a bit of effort.</p>
