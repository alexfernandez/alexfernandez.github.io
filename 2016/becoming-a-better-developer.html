<p>So you want to become a better developer? No matter what your current status is, this simple guide will give you a few tips to help you improve.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I will include my personal experiences in colored boxes like this one, just so you know where I am coming from.
</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-the-novice">Advice For The Novice</h2>
<p>So you are starting in our noble and worthy profession, or maybe haven't even started yet but want to get in for the fame and riches.</p>
<h3 id="is-attending-university-worth-it">Is Attending University Worth It?</h3>
<p>The profession of software developer here in Spain is taught in &quot;ingeniería informática&quot;, which is an adaptation of the french term <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9nie_informatique">&quot;ingénierie informatique&quot;</a>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I studied physics, under the notion that I could learn how to program by myself, but I would never get to learn science properly if I studied computers. I believe I was basically right: it was one of the few good decisions I made as a teenager. I don't think that studying software engineering is useless; it's probably fine for most people.
</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing debate in Spain for many years about unauthorized practice in software engineering. Here is <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/sobre-intrusismo-profesional.html">my take (in Spanish)</a>. I have always wondered how you would forbid other people from developing software. Apparently software engineers want the exclusive right to sign software projects.</p>
<p>Many fine developers have just studied secondary school, and maybe earned a title in vocational education and training.</p>
<h3 id="bootcamps">Bootcamps</h3>
<p>It is a great day for software development: our skills are in such high demand that many cool companies are willing to take in people that have learned the basics of our profession in about 8 weeks. They are not cheap though.</p>
<p>They are not just for outsiders. I have met quite a few people that were already working as developers, and just wanted to recycle themselves.</p>
<h3 id="life-as-a-junior">Life As A Junior</h3>
<p>If you are a junior developer at a company, you want to be sure that there are really senior people you can learn from.</p>
<h2 id="get-ahead-of-the-curve">Get Ahead Of The Curve</h2>
<p>Now let us consider intermediate developers: you have been in the industry for a few years,</p>
<h3 id="so-are-you-good-already">So Are You Good Already?</h3>
<p>According to a stupid popular notion, one half of everything is below average. This is only true if the quality can be measured, and it follows a Gaussian distribution. This distinction is not just a fine point: many important variables follow highly skewed distributions.</p>
<p>Let me give you just one example. Household income is one of these highly skewed quantities. According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/532416/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2014-2015.pdf">a report</a> by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-199495-to-201415">UK Department for Work and Pensions</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2014/15 just under two-thirds of individuals had a household income less than the national mean average (£581 per week).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps developer quality is similarly skewed. But first we need to ask an uncomfortable question: how can we measure developer quality?</p>
<h3 id="distribution-of-good-developers">Distribution Of Good Developers</h3>
<h3 id="your-comfort-zone">Your &quot;Comfort Zone&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the #@&amp;! would I want to leave my comfort zone? Do these people even know what &quot;comfort&quot; means?</p>

<p>Instead of vague feely-goody sentences, we may offer concrete advice.</p>
<p>Learn a new language. Use a new framework for your next pet project. Always keep learning.</p>
<h3 id="find-your-specialty">Find Your Specialty</h3>
<p>You cannot be a top developer by just being a generalist.</p>
<h3 id="get-involved-in-the-community">Get Involved In The Community</h3>
<h2 id="top-of-the-cream-of-the-crop">Top Of The Cream Of The Crop</h2>
<p>Now we come to the most delicate part. So you are finally what we may call &quot;an excellent developer&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="trust-me-im-an-engineer">Trust Me, I'm An Engineer</h3>
<p>&quot;Engineer&quot; is in many countries a prestigious title, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engineer#Etymology">derived</a> from latin <em>ingenium</em> (cleverness).</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>programmer</strong> is tasked with writing a program, supposedly starting with a detailed specification.</li>
<li>A <strong>developer</strong> has wider responsibilities: create a software system that solves a certain problem.</li>
<li>An <strong>engineer</strong> is tasked with devising a solution to a necessity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bring-me-problems-not-solutions">Bring Me Problems, Not Solutions</h3>
<p>Quite often engineers are characterized as problem-solvers: bring me a problem and I will give you a solution. But that is not how a real-world engineer usually operates. Once you find the problem it usually easy to solve it. The real challenge is in finding the problem.</p>
<p>Oh, somebody may come with a high-level business target. For old-school engineers the business target might be: let the people of this town cross this river, or accomodate the incoming traffic for the next 20 years. For a software engineer it can be: keep costs below a certain mark, or connect to a server within a latency number.</p>
<h3 id="the-myth-of-the-10x-engineer">The Myth Of The 10x Engineer</h3>
<p>Many years ago, some people did a few programming tests, and found out that certain developers finished their assignments ten times faster than the average. From there a myth has been derived that says that certain engineers are ten times better than average.</p>
<p>In the words of Betsy Haibel in <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/hacker-mythologies-and-mismanagement">Hacker Mythologies and Mismanagement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The myth of the 10x engineer is derived from a game of telephone: a 1968 study by Sackman, Erikson, and Grant, briefly quoted in one chapter of Frederick Brooks’s The Mythical Man-Month. This study found order-of-magnitude differences in programmer productivity on some narrow measures, but was also methodologically flawed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a great article and I cannot recommend it more.</p>
<h3 id="let-the-world-know">Let The World Know</h3>
<p>Go give talks around. Just send proposals to conferences. It is a great way to attend amazing events for free!</p>
<h3 id="be-ready-to-resharpen-your-skills">Be Ready to Resharpen Your Skills</h3>
<p>Even if you are at the top of the game, in our industry there are no guarantees.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
About five years ago I left my job at ING Direct Spain after four years as a project manager. At that point I <a href="http://alexfernandez.github.io/2016/mib-five-years-later.html">co-founded a startup</a> that ultimately went nowhere, but allowed me to recycle myself starting to program again.
</p>
<p>Just look at what the tech landscape looked like five years ago. In 2011 containers were the realm of VMWare: Docker did not exist, and Linux developers were busy merging container-related patches into the kernel. Internet Explorer was the <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201101-201112">most used browser globally</a>, and Chrome was just overtaking Firefox in the second place. Mobile OSs were far below desktop operating systems: both iOS and Android were below Mac OS in <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-os-ww-monthly-201101-201112">browser stats</a>. HTML5 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#2011.C2.A0.E2.80.93_Last_Call">being finalized</a> and was not yet a recommended standard. Node.js was at <a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/history-of-node-js/">version 0.6.0</a>. Meanwhile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29#Versions">Java 7 was just released</a> but not widely adopted (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">Oracle had just bought Sun</a> a year ago).</p>
<p>If you want to have a long and prosperous career you can either look for some obscure niche where there is no competition (think COBOL programmers today), or update your skills constantly.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories was of a mainframe programmer.</p>
<h3 id="teach-others">Teach Others</h3>
<p>There is a reason why a very accomplished professional is called a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/master#Etymology_1">&quot;master&quot;</a>, which also happens to mean &quot;teacher&quot;. This goes beyond an Occidental tradition. In martial arts movies great experts always have their own schools.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No matter where you stand in your profession, you can always get better.</p>
