Five years ago I was working at a largish bank
(ING Direct, now called ING Bank, Spain)
as a project manager.
In the middle of the mortgage bubble crisis,
the bank decided to go without my services,
and things were not looking good.
This is the story of how I founded a company,
did not get rich,
and in the process got to be much happier.

## ING Direct

In 2007 I was hired at ING Direct as an analyst:
a technical position that was more or less like a coordinator.
A couple of years later I was told that I had made it as a project manager,
so I finally needed not touch any code any more.
This, needless to say, made me very unhappy.
Then the bank, in its infinite wisdom, decided to externalize all development work.
In retrospect, I could have realized at that point that my future would not be very bright,
and look for greener pastures.
But I plodded on as a project manager,
juggling an ever increasing number of projects
as the technical manager for financial cards.

In 2010 I was commended by the bosses after a successful integration.
At a large company you are never safe;
if [Zach Holman isn't safe](https://zachholman.com/posts/fired/),
who is?
Certainly not me,
who had never been able to keep my big mouth shut about things I did not like.
In mid-2011, after a disastrous Q2 review,
the head of IT and operations called me to his office
and let me know that I no longer had a future at the bank.
I negotiated a generous severance package
(one year salary)
and left the bank.

This happened almost exactly five years ago.
I had a two-year-old daughter,
a mortgage and no job.

## MoveinBlue

My good friend [Diego Lafuente](https://twitter.com/tufosa)
had told me about a little project of his:
together with a few of his colleagues at
[Fedit](http://fedit.com/)
they were planning to set up a startup.

So I conferred with my partner (and mother of my child),
and told her that I really, really wanted to join MoveinBlue full-time.

### Our Mission

Revolutionize how we all plan our holidays.
That is what we set out to do.

### Being the CTO

Being the person with most experience

### Minding Our Own Business

Since the beginning our fortunes were sealed.

At our peak, MoveinBlue had more than 10 people employed full time.

### A Good Ride

## The Aftermath

For me, MoveinBlue has been
