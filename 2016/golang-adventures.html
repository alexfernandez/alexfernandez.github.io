<p>This week I had the opportunity to play with Go (or &quot;Golang&quot; as has come to be known) for a work-related project. It is not the first occasion that we meet, but now I am serious about it. And I have to vent my frustrations with the language.</p>
<h2 id="the-language">The Language</h2>
<h3 id="adding-elements-to-an-array">Adding Elements to an Array</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/slices">arrays are different from slices</a>.</p>
<h3 id="error-management">Error Management</h3>
<p>Sick of the <code>if (error) return callback(error)</code> bullshit? Brace yourself.</p>
<p>Functions can return several arguments:</p>
<pre><code>func getObject(value Object) (Object, error) {
    return value, nil
}</code></pre>
<p>Cool, you can return <code>nil</code> instead of the second argument. So you probably can return <code>nil</code> also as the first argument if there is an error? <strong>Bzzzt!</strong> Wrong. <em>Obviously</em> you cannot [return <code>nil</code> as a struct], for reasons that are very well explained in that link (but I will not probably understand if I live five consecutive lives).</p>
<p>So when you find an error you have to return an empty object, which must be initialized first:</p>
<pre><code>func getObject(value Object) (Object, error) {
    newObject, err := accessSomeDB(value.Key)
    empty := Object{}
    if err != nil {
        return empty, nil
    }
    return value, nil
}</code></pre>
<p>So now be ready to write this bit quite often:</p>
<pre><code>if err != nil {
    return empty, nil
}</code></pre>
<p>Of course, with non-optional braces. At least the <code>if (error) return callback(error)</code> was an invariant.</p>
<h3 id="variable-declarations">Variable Declarations</h3>
<p>This one looks inoffensive enough but can be most annoying. To declare and define (give value) a variable you use the <code>:=</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>a := 5</code></pre>
<p>While to just give a value to an existing variable you use the <code>=</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>var a string;
a = 5</code></pre>
<p>So, what happens is that if your code uses the same variable several times (for instance the ubiquitous <code>err</code>) you will find this joy:</p>
<pre><code>err := callFirst()
err := callSecond()</code></pre>
<p>results in</p>
<pre><code>main.go:10: no new variables on left side of :=</code></pre>
<p>Therefore you have to change the second invocation to:</p>
<pre><code>err := callFirst()
err = callSecond()</code></pre>
<p>Ending one of the joys of programming, the ease of copy-paste. Or defining the variable ahead of time with this clumsy wart:</p>
<pre><code>var err error</code></pre>
<p>Observe that the error message says &quot;no new variables&quot;: it is OK to reuse <code>err</code> as long as there is a new variable there.</p>
<pre><code>first, err := callFirst()
second, err := callSecond()</code></pre>
<p>This works! So one new variable and one old variable is fine; but only one old variable is not. Even ignoring the return value is <em>not</em> OK:</p>
<pre><code>_, err := callFirst()
_, err := callSecond()</code></pre>
<p>This fails, don't ask me why; just the compiler being helpful I guess. The end result is that you spend time changing <code>=</code> to <code>:=</code> and viceversa, for no good reason. I'm too old for this crap.</p>
<h3 id="implicit-conversions">Implicit Conversions</h3>
<p>Did you know that in Go you cannot simply divide <code>6 / 4</code> and expect the answer to be <code>1.5</code>? It does not <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/LXL4L0jzWXU">perform implicit conversions</a> as you might expect from a language designed this century. So you first have to do an explicit conversion, leading to such fun errors as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cannot use n / d (type int) as type float32 in return argument</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But as it happens, Go isn't even able to compare an integer with a float:</p>
<pre><code>    var myFloat = float64(5)
    var myInt = 5
    if myFloat &gt; myInt {
        return true
    }   
...

invalid operation: myFloat &gt; myInt (mismatched types float64 and int)</code></pre>
<p>This is clearly going too far with one's beliefs against automatic conversions. This is why you will occasionally see unholy messes like this:</p>
<pre><code>    var myFloat = float64(5)
    var myInt = 5
    if myFloat &gt; float64(myInt) {
        return true
    }   </code></pre>
<p>But this same line with constants works, just to annoy you personally:</p>
<pre><code>    if 1 &gt; 2.0 {
        return true
    }   </code></pre>
<h3 id="mandatory-brace-style">Mandatory Brace Style</h3>
<p>Some people like the correct style for braces: nice and symmetrical. I'm talking of course of the &quot;brace on the next line&quot; school of thought:</p>
<pre><code>if something
{
    something else
}</code></pre>
<p>Other people like the more compact notation with &quot;brace on the same line&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>if something {
    something else
}</code></pre>
<p>It is of course wrong, and in fact many of the proponents then add an empty line.</p>
<p>Here Go takes sides, and chooses the worst possible solution: mandating one true style. From the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#semicolons">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the advantages of a single, programmatically mandated format for all Go programs greatly outweigh any perceived disadvantages of the particular style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not cool, people. You may shut up Googlers from having the sempiternal brace debate, but you cannot <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/rzLzp_Z74ik%5B1-25%5D">shut</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/2jpzpd/brace_yourself_a_small_script_for_converting/">us</a> <a href="http://zerospace.org/goallman.php">people</a> <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.go.general/19965">up</a>!</p>
<h3 id="just-making-shit-up">Just Making Shit Up</h3>
<p>Sometimes you get the impression that, as the creators of Go went along, they realized that it lacked some very basic capability and added it as a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/">&quot;built-in function&quot;</a>. There are 15 of these abominations.</p>
<p>A good example is <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action">maps</a>. So you declare an array of campaigns:</p>
<pre><code>var campaigns map[string]Campaign</code></pre>
<p>But then have to populate it, how? Easy, with a built-in function:</p>
<pre><code>campaigns = make(map[string]Campaign)</code></pre>
<p>There you have to specify the kind of map you want to make, again. Why? You already know the type, Obnoxious Gopher!</p>
<p>The fun doesn't end with <code>make()</code> though. Just look at what they have to say about <code>println()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Println is useful for bootstrapping and debugging; it is not guaranteed to stay in the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore declaring that bootstrapping and debugging is not guaranteed for these frolicking gophers.</p>
<p>Granted, there are also built-in functions in JavaScript, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects">about 12</a>. Of these, <code>escape()</code> and <code>unescape()</code> are holdouts from a different era; <code>eval()</code> is widely discredited.</p>
<p>In the end <code>parseInt()</code>, <code>parseFloat()</code> and the URI things are the only functions in use, and they are quite low-level really.</p>
<h2 id="tooling">Tooling</h2>
<p>This area is of course ladden with misery and despair, with a few bright spots.</p>
<h3 id="anal-retentive-compiler.">Anal Retentive Compiler.</h3>
<p>Nothing that has not been <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/four-days-of-go.html">said better before</a>. Just one nitpick: why forbid unused imports and variables, but allow unused functions? Aren't unused functions equally (or even more) dangerous? This question has been bothering me for some time.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>There is a very nice feature of the toolchain: <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">integrated testing</a>. You can write a few tests as functions that start with <code>Test...</code> and run them all using <code>go test</code>. Nice!</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't come without its share of weirdness. For starters, you may not mix testing code and regular code. I know it's frowned upon in many circles, but it is often quite handy: change your code, then scroll down and change the tests. At least I would like to have the option.</p>
<p>Then, files that contains tests <em>need</em> to be called <code>..._test.go</code>. This seems like a sensible addition, until you try to autocomplete from the console to access your regular file <code>campaigns.go</code> instead of your testing file <code>campaigns_test.go</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ campaigns[tab]
campaigns.go campaigns_test.go</code></pre>
<p>One extra key per file! Outrageous. As long as you avoid the urge to name your testing file just as your regular file, and name your tests <code>integration_test.go</code> or <code>convoluted_test.go</code>, all is fine.</p>
<h2 id="the-help">The Help</h2>
<p>You are programming in Go, so you are probably going to need some help. How do you go about it?</p>
<h3 id="the-name">The Name</h3>
<p>First, let me get this off my chest: why on Earth would someone create a language with a name that cannot be searched? Especially someone working for Google, which by the way runs the world's biggest <em>search engine</em>!</p>
<p>Usually it is fine to search for &quot;golang...&quot;, but once in a while you forget and are greeted by innumerable pages helping you play Go (the Eastern board game), or any other weird stuff (did you know there's a game called &quot;Go Repo&quot;, now I do).</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>With JavaScript finding help is very easy: the semi-official docs are in</p>
<p>Now Go had it <em>much</em> easier: there is an official creator, sponsor and source for everything Go. Why then is everything spread in a lot of places?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some questions are answered on StackOverflow, yes, but others are only found in arcane Google Groups, and even others are on Reddit, for crying out loud.</p></li>
<li><p>The official documentation is too terse and lacks examples. For those, you have to go to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/">The Go Blog</a>, or just start browsing random blogs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-redis-driver">The Redis Driver</h2>
<p>So you want to do some easy task, say: access a local Redis database. Let's find a simple driver. Redis is one of the <a href="http://stackshare.io/posts/top-50-developer-tools-and-services-of-2015#top-50">most popular NoSQL databases</a>, and Golang has <a href="http://www.modulecounts.com/">more than 100k packages</a>, rivalling Maven or rubygems. So it shouldn't be hard, right?</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/modulecounts.png" title="Module Counts for many popular package repositories" alt="Module Counts" /><p class="caption"><a href="http://www.modulecounts.com/">Module Counts</a></p>
</div>
<p>Right???</p>
<h3 id="redigo">Redigo</h3>
<p>This is one of <a href="http://redis.io/clients#go">the recommended clients for Redis</a>. The <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis">documentation</a> is cryptic to the extreme.</p>
<h3 id="go-redis">Go-redis</h3>
<p>Complete, and well documented. Nice, huh? So you want to install onto your Debian testing machine, and this happens:</p>
<pre><code>$ go get gopkg.in/redis.v3
# gopkg.in/redis.v3
../../.gocode/src/gopkg.in/redis.v3/pool.go:144: undefined: atomic.Value</code></pre>
<p>What is this evil? Googling <code>go-redis &quot;undefined: atomic.Value&quot;</code> will not yield an answer, but Google helpfully removes the quotes and returns this <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/1584">related page</a> for a different project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You need Go 1.4 or a later version to build go-ethereum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, Debian packs Go 1.3, and the latest Ubuntu with long term support (14.04) is even worse: Go 1.2.</p>
<p>So at this point backwards compatibility is not one of the selling points for Go.</p>
<h3 id="radix">Radix</h3>
<p>This recommended <a href="https://github.com/mediocregopher/radix.v2">package</a> is broken into several subpackages. I don't know where to start here.</p>
<h3 id="godis">Godis</h3>
<p>This driver works reasonably well, but it hasn't been updated since 2012. An ominous note on <a href="https://github.com/simonz05/godis">the front page</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 Aug 2012 Currently very busy with work, and I don't have the time to fix some of the pending issues at hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And nothing else, looks like the recovered diary from a long lost expedition.</p>
<p>So now let's read a hash of organizations from Redis:</p>
<pre><code>elem, err := driver.Hgetall(key)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
log.Printf(&quot;orgs &quot;, len(elem.Elems))
if len(elem.Elems) == 0 {
    return errors.New(&quot;Organizations not found&quot;)
}
for index, subelem := range elem.Elems {
    log.Printf(&quot;read &quot;, subelem.Elem.String())
    if index % 2 == 0 {
        continue
    }
    organization := Organization{}
    err = json.Unmarshal(subelem.Elem.Bytes(), &amp;organization)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    err = readCampaigns(organization.Id)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
}
log.Printf(&quot;Read %v campaigns&quot;, len(campaigns))
return nil</code></pre>
<p>This is like a kaleidoscope of weird issues.</p>
<p>Since Go doesn't have generics, you will have to repeat this crappy code every time you want to read a different hash.</p>
<h2 id="assorted-issues">Assorted Issues</h2>
<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>The good thing about Go is that it is open source. Everyone can look at the source code, even send a pull request...</p>
<p>What is that in the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go">README.md</a>, you say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we do not accept pull requests and that we use the issue tracker for bug reports and proposals only. Please ask questions on https://forum.golangbridge.org or https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oopsie.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a <a href="https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html">most convoluted process</a> to contribute your code. Say you find a simple bug in the code, easy to fix but which is hindering your work. You have to register in five different places and then fax them your birth certificate or something, so that they ensure that you ar really who you say you are (and more devoted than the Pope).</p>
<h3 id="installing-from-source">Installing from Source</h3>
<p>So the version of Go in your distribution is a bit out of date (meaning that nothing works any more, or is unavoidably slow). Just grab the sources and <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install/source">compile your own</a>, then. You just need to have a modern version of Go installed, and... Wait, what?</p>
<p>Sorry, the Go toolchain is written in Go, and therefore requires Go to be compiled. So you need to download the Go binaries, and <em>only then</em> can you compile from source.</p>
<p>Remember when I said that Debian packs Go 1.3 (and Ubuntu LTS Go 1.2)? The latest version of Go is 1.6 and was released a couple of days ago, so it's still quite shiny. But it requires Go 1.4 to compile, so there is one extra step of downloading an intermediate version, building, installing <em>and then</em> going for 1.6. Isn't life great?</p>
<p>In the end I just installed the binary version and moved on with my (now a bit more miserable) life.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>In the end all is fine, since you get such great performance. Except when you use Go 1.3 where HTTP requests to the server are not concurrent (for some reason). Or when you upgrade to Go 1.6 and your program has exploded in flames after spouting this most modest of messages:</p>
<pre><code>fatal error: concurrent map read and map write</code></pre>
<p>Then you have to visit <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action">an arcane blog post</a> for a mysterious incantation which turns your code into a minion of Cthulhu that uses <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#RWMutex">mutexes</a>:</p>
<pre><code>var counter = struct{
    sync.RWMutex
    m map[string]int
}{m: make(map[string]int)}</code></pre>
<p>Well, that's the price you pay for concurrency. And thankfully it performs just as well, which makes you think: why didn't the high priests of the language implement it by default? The FAQ <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#atomic_maps">helpfully explains</a> (and allow me to glose):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore requiring that all map operations grab a mutex would slow down most programs and add safety to few.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mean it would slow down <em>trivial</em> programs and add safety to <em>those that matter</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was not an easy decision, however, since it means uncontrolled map access can crash the program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's nice to know that you have lost sleep over this matter, but hey, my programs are still crashing...</p>
<h2 id="a-might-have-been">A Might Have Been</h2>
<p>So, what drove Google to create a new language?</p>
<h3 id="the-bleeding-name">The Bleeding Name</h3>
<p>People, if you ever create a language, use a distinctive word that can be googled. &quot;Golang&quot; would have been fine; &quot;Go&quot; is <a href="http://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp?s=y">the 35th most common word in English</a>. Not cool.</p>
<h3 id="what-could-have-been">What Could Have Been</h3>
<p>All these annoyances are not only a pain in the ass, but make Go a huge missed opportunity.</p>
<p>It is a pity because I liked the idea very much: a compiled language that is very performant and which solves concurrency with elegance. A noble successor to C indeed. But if there is something that C is not, is opinionated: it adapts to your style and is flexible enough to accomodate everyone. Alas, that is something that the creators of Go deemed <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#semicolons">unworthy of their time</a>.</p>
