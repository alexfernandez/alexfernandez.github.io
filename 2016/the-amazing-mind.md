## How Does The Mind Work?

Our mind is a strange thing.
For starters, it is able to study itself.
How many things do you know that are able to study themselves?
It can create theories to explain how it works,
or assign some meaning to its existence.
It can even ponder its place in the Universe.

Science has had enormous success explaining how other things work.
From the largest galaxies to the smallest particles,
passing through most objects around us,
we have created satisfying theories even if they still have large gaps;
it would seem as it was just a matter of time before they are filled.
But for all our efforts,
we have remarkably little to show as to the inner workings of the mind itself.

Sure, we know that the brain is made of neurons;
we have accurate maps of when they fire and why;
we know of our many failings and biases in most areas of thought.
But how do firing neurons become ideas?
How are concepts stored in our brains?
This large chasm between the physical world and the realm of psychology
is still largely a mystery.
Even if we can simulate a small network of neurons
and make it recognize a cat from a dog,
there are no insights in artificial intelligence
that can explain how the human mind processes information about the world around us.

It is my view that we need a new effort to explain how the mind works from first principles,
instead of trying to come at it from the low level of neuron constructions
or from behavioral examinations of our many failings.
This article is an attempt to come at such a basic explanation,
see how it explains common phenomena that we can observe every day,
and only then look at how it might be implemented inside our skulls.

## Concepts

Let us start with the most basic element of thought:
a concept.
We will define it as anything that can be thought about.

A concept is connected to other concepts by relations.
These relations can in turn become new concepts.
So, how can a concept be defined?
Only in its relation to other concepts.
And how can a relation be defined?
Only as the way to associate two or more concepts.

Let us for now accept this circular definition,
even if it is not particularly rigorous.
The usual definition for "concept" only includes abstract ideas
that can be applied to many situations,
while here we will include concrete things.
I can definitely think about my neighbor's dog,
or about the topmost hair on some person's head;
from the moment that i think about it,
and that it starts having relations to other concepts,
it becomes a concept in itself.

Each person has embedded in their mind a network of concepts,
specific to themselves.
For instance,
if my mother usually wore red clothes
it would only be natural if in my mind the concepts of
"red" and "mother" were associated.
That relation may make no sense to many other people.

### The Accelerating Mind

It is a common experience that as we age
[time appears to go faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIx2N-viNwY).
How can we make sense of this phenomenon using our definition?
As we grow older we have more and more concepts in our brain.
Any new concept needs to be related to the existing concepts;
therefore an older person will assimilate new information more slowly.

When processing any situation,
an old person will have to check many different concepts.
The response will be slower, but more thorough.
A younger person may react faster to it,
but not take into account a vital relation.

### Subconscious Relations

Not all relations are conscious:
sometimes we know that there is a relation between two concepts
but cannot explain why.

The process of thought that creates a relation
is not always remembered, or even known.
Children do not form long-term memories until they have a certain age,
usually two or three years.

### Behavior

We know that certain things give us pleasure,
while others cause pain.
Each concept may be associated with either pain or pleasure.
Concepts related to those will in turn inherit some of that association.
It is well known that experiencing something that reminds us of a painful experience becomes painful by association.

### Mourning

People in mourning take a long time to accept the loss of someone near.
The closer the deceased was, the longer it takes.
The process can be seen as rewriting one's mind:
all of the concepts that related to this person need to be updated
with the new information that they are no longer alive.

## Words

The definition of a word is not an exact process.
If we asked a thousand people to define the term "dog",
each person will probably give a different definition.

It is interesting to note that illiterate people, like children,
do not possess the concept of "definition".
They just explain what a word means by analogy, metaphora or euphemism:
"A dog is an animal",
"A dog has sharp teeth",
"A dog is a man's best friend".
It is very hard to make them attempt a definition which aims to be complete and unambiguous.

So, what is a complete definition of a word?
In the case of "dog" it is a kind of animal,
so to provide a thorough definition a full description might be required:
anatomy, phisiology, evolution, history.
The process becomes more and more ridiculous
as we go down to describe all of the peculiar proteins that conform its genetic code.
It might be reasonable to stop once we reach a certain level.
But this is just for one kind of dog:
how can one be expected to specify aspect or size for an animal
which is bred into such an enormous number of races and varieties?
What about mixes?

We may be tempted to just give enough information
to tell a dog apart from other similar animals,
but even then there are complications.
There are many different meanings for any common word.
A "dog" can be an animal,
but it can also be a colloquial way to call a friend,
a derogatory term for a person,
a tool,
or a Chinese zodiac sign.
For "dog" we may identify the animal as the primary meaning;
for other words such as "beauty" we have no such luck.
Any complete definition would need to include these other meanings.

Then there are regional variations of what the word means,
which can be searched until we find small groups that use it for different purposes.
Temporal shifts in the use of the word can also be relevant.
Then there are uses of the word in popular culture that add connotations,
change its purpose or make it adopt new meanings.

In short, it is impossible to yield a complete definition.
Any word is inextricably linked to many other words,
and those in turn to others,
until to explain any basic idea you need to describe the whole world.
To explain a word is thus to place it in relation to the world.

Each word has infinite notes that define it.
A definition stops arbitrarily at a certain level of detail,
which differs from a dictionary to an encyclopaedia.
For any given speaker,
the definition tapers to personal stories about encounters with what the word represents.

### Words And Concepts

Is a word a concept?
Undoubtedly:
as we have seen words are defined by their relation to other words,
just as concepts.
But the reverse is not necessarily true.

There are many concepts in our mind to which we have not yet given a particular word.
Others can only be described by a combination of words,
such as "the feeling I get when I enter an enclosed space that makes me comfortable".
I can recognize it,
speak about it or try to define it;
but I don't have a word for it.
Yet; I may later learn that there is a word for it.

It needs to be pointed that some words are not originally concepts:
they are merely grammatical aids to express our ideas.
Words like "the", "at" or "thus" do not have regular definitions,
just descriptions as parts of the sentence.
But since they can be thought and reasoned about,
they automatically become concepts.

The art of reasoning about words is called "Philosophy".
The study of the organization of words in sentences is called "Grammar".
It is not a coincidence that the first peoples to study philosophy
were also the first grammarians.

### My Blue And Your Blue

Is the color blue that I see the same as the color blue that you see?
There is a very simple answer to this question using our definition:
no, my color blue is different than your color blue,
and will always be.
My color blue is tinged by all of the experiences that I have had in my life
where the color blue has played a part:
all of the blue things that I have seen have left an imprint.
The same happens to any other person,
and so each one will have a different sensation when they see something blue.

If my relation to blue things has been predominantly positive I may like blue things.
Conversely, if I have had a very negative experience involving the color blue
then I may dislike blue things, consciously or not.

But while words can be shared, concepts cannot.
In using a word we are accepting the inputs of other people on it.
Each time we hear a word we are adding notes to it.

## Reality

Reality is supposedly an objective construct that is independent of any person
looking at or thinking about it.
But as we will see,
reality is much simpler and much more complex at the same time.

Reality is formed by all the words that exist.
Each person has a different view of the world
which is formed by all of the concepts they handle.
But as we have seen concepts are not shared.
If we want to build a shared view of the world
it needs to be done with words,
imperfect as they are in capturing concepts.
This common view is thus reality.

### Reality And Truth

Does saying an idea enough times make it true?
Not necessarily; but it makes the idea part of reality.
In that sense, any idea becomes more real the more it is repeated.
It takes considerable effort to distinguish "real" from "true",
and for many people there is no difference.

Many people will speak about their favorite characters in a novel or a TV show
as if they were alive.
As long as they have entered our collective minds,
they have become part of reality,
and therefore they are real.
In a sense they are more real than living people who are unknown to us.
