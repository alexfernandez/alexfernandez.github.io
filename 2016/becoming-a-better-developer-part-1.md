So you want to become a better developer?
This [guide](becoming-a-better-developer.html) is divided into four parts,
the first one (the one in your hands right now)
is devoted to people wanting to start a career in software development.

Tips to help you improve are shown **in bold**.

<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
Personal experiences will appear in colored boxes like this one.
</p>

## Start Me Up

You want to try out the profession of software developer
for fame and riches.
You have heard that recruiters are offering very well paid jobs,
and that all of the cool girls and boys are working in the field.
So how can you get in?

### Vocation And Devotion

First let us do some soul-searching.
Do you really want to spend your days (and some nights)
crouched upon a computer keyboard,
letting a screen (however large)
be your only contact with the world?
Do you have in you the will power to spend countless hours tracking a bug?

Software development is not an easy career to follow.
Many people have found that there are other profitable career paths,
some of them related to software development:
marketing, UX design, sales.

### Is University Worth It?

The profession of software developer here in Spain is taught in "ingeniería informática",
which is an adaptation of the french term
["ingénierie informatique"](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9nie_informatique).
In the US there are several universities offering "computer engineering",
whatever it is;
and some even offer [software engineering](http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12).

But honestly, any other science-related degree can be good enough.

Not even a degree may be necessary.
Many fine developers have just studied secondary school,
and maybe earned a title in vocational education and training.
Not that University is worthless;
but its value depends a lot of what you do with it.

<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I studied physics,
under the notion that I could learn how to program by myself,
but I would never get to learn science properly if I studied computers.
I believe I was basically right:
it was one of the few good decisions I made as a teenager.
I don't think that studying software engineering is useless;
it's probably fine for most people.
</p>

And University is not necessarily the best way to work as a developer.
So if you are doing it as an investment and getting into an enormous debt,
please reconsider.

### Bootcamps

There is an easier way to acquire some education and access our noble profession.
It is a great day for software development:
our skills are in such high demand that many cool companies are willing to take in
people that have learned the basics of our profession in 8 to 12 weeks.
They are not cheap though.
Prepare to pay about a thousand dollars per week.

Bootcamps are not just for outsiders.
I have met quite a few people that were already working as developers,
and just wanted to recycle themselves in a different field.

How can you know if a bootcamp is any good?
It depends a lot on how exigent they are.
If they are ready to accept anyone then the level is probably not very high.
If there is a selection process just to get in,
and many people are rejected,
then you can trust that it will be worth it.
Keep in mind that only hopeless cases fail to finish the bootcamp,
so any selection needs to be done *before* it starts.

### Pet Project

By far, the best way to learn a new language, framework or environment
is doing a pet project using it.
That way, the project supplies the motivation
and you only need to fill in the details.

This is also a great presentation card for a prospective employer.

<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
I was writing a book that never materialized,
in an obscure editor called [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/).
I started [eLyXer](https://github.com/alexfernandez/elyxer)
to help me convert it to HTML;
it was very useful to learn Python.
Later on I wrote
[milliearth](https://github.com/alexfernandez/milliearth),
and then [loadtest](https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest).
I have learned a lot of Node.js with these two projects.
</p>

Even if your pet project gets nowhere near your original objective,
the learning experience will probably compensate for it.

**Pet projects are not just for job seekers;
they are great for developers of all levels.**

### Getting That Job

So you have decided you want a job.
How can you get it?
Julia Grace, engineering director at Slack,
[says](http://www.juliahgrace.com/blog/2015/4/9/an-unconventional-guide-for-getting-a-software-engineering-job):

> [...] find someone at the company (search their About pages, which often have links to employees’ LinkedIn, Twitter accounts, etc.) and email that person asking about the company.
> I’m not saying you should harass them, just politely reach out, indicate you’re interested in the company, ask for advice on how to apply.
> Most people want to help.

The whole article is very interesting as it reframes a lot of common points of view.

Do not throw CVs around like it's Christmas;
instead, focus on places where you _really_ want to work.
Prepare for them, check what they like,
what they looking for,
the kind of interviews that they do.
Keep in mind that it is better to apply to 5 places thoughtfully
than to 100 random companies.

But first you have to decide if you prefer to work at a startup
or at an established company.
Keep in mind that startups will probably offer more responsibility
and will have you do many different tasks,
while large companies tend to have established roles
and it can be difficult to change projects.
Whatever rocks your boat.

Many companies will feature coding tests:
give you an assignment to complete in a set time.
From the point of view of the employer,
it's only natural that you should show how you build software
if that is what you will be doing at work!
The best tests should not take longer than a couple of hours.

At <a href="https://mediasmart.io/">mediasmart</a>
we create a coding test with five or six stages.
Several of our developers will do it beforehand to gauge how long it should take,
and keep only enough stages for an hour or so.
We send the first one by email the morning before to all candidates,
so they can do it at their leisure;
if they do not perform well under pressure,
at least they have something to show.
The rest of the stages are done under our supervision,
and they have to complete as many as possible in an hour.
It is an excellent way to test the abilities of a candidate.
There is a certain pressure on candidates,
but knowing how they perform under stress is also valuable.

<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
Once we had a candidate that said that he had completed the first stage the night before.
When asked to produce the code, he said that he had solved it "in his head".
Bad sign!
Afterwards he was not able to complete even the first stage,
which supposedly he had finished at home.
</p>

**Do your research.
Prepare to show your work,
and how you work.**

Other companies like to place you in front of a whiteboard
and ask questions about algorithms and theoretical problems.
I distrust these tests;
they are nothing like the work you will later do.
But hey, if Google do it, then it cannot be wrong,
[right](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?_r=0)?

In any case, many people spend months preparing for an interview at Google.
It may be worth it given the salaries they pay!

**Study how the companies you like hire,
and prepare for it.**

## Conclusion

In this first part we have seen how to start working as a software developer.
It is important to choose the right company,
or you may end up wasting a couple of years of your career.
