<h2 id="people-that-sign-up-but-fail-to-come">People that Sign Up But
Fail to Come</h2>
<p>A common issue you hear from community organizers is: a lot of people
will sign up for an event, but when the day comes, very few of them
actually show up.</p>
<p>As co-organizer of <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/">MadridJS</a>, one of the
largest tech communities in Spain, I know what they are talking about. A
couple of times (<a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/225252829/">1st</a>
and <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/226037202/">2nd</a>)
we have had more than 250 people sign up, but then less than 80 have
showed up. At <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Node-js-Madrid/">Node.js Madrid</a>
which I also help organize, we have pretty much the same story.
Attendance figures for us are usually between 30~50%, although some
communities report going as high as 80% or as low as 10%.</p>
<h3 id="negative-motivations">Negative Motivations</h3>
<p>When asked, people give multiple excuses for not showing up: too much
work, last-minute meetings, family obligations are the most common. But
just about the same happens when events are organized on a weekend when
there are no work-related pressures. In the best case, going to an event
means devoting a lot of energy to an activity which is not directly a
money generator. In the worst case, many people in tech communities are
introverts (me included), so meeting other people in person can be
stressful and not a general experience. A talk is more or less
anonymous, but for some, being in the same room with a lot of people is
not nice.</p>
<p>I have personally signed up for events in other communities and then
when the day comes, laziness has got the best of me. So I find it hard
to blame those that do the same. What are your personal experiences?</p>
<h3 id="proposals">Proposals</h3>
<p>During the last <a
href="http://clsxmadrid.es/index.en.html">Community Leadership Summit
Madrid</a>, many proposals were discussed by community organizers. Among
them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make people pay a token amount (e.g.¬†‚Ç¨1) when signing up, then spend
the proceedings in drinks after the event.</li>
<li>Make people pay some money (from ‚Ç¨1 to ‚Ç¨5), but give it back to
those that actually show up; spend the rest in drinks.</li>
<li>Take attendance at every event, and expel from the community people
that fail to come more than three times.</li>
<li>Announce meetups as late as possible, so there is less chance of
unexpected issues.</li>
<li>Do not stream or record the event, so people are forced to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice a common pattern? Most of the proposals are negative; many
have the common theme of punishing people that sign up but don‚Äôt come.
In other words: use the stick instead of the carrot.</p>
<p>There are also practical issues with certain ideas. Having people pay
for events means that Meetup.com (or any other payment processor) will
keep a percent of the proceedings. It will also exclude those without a
suitable payment option, apart from people for which ‚Ç¨1 is relevant; for
professionals it may not be much, but for e.g.¬†students it can be a big
deterrent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tucamon.es/">CAMON</a>, the old venue where we
used to meet at MadridJS, forced us to control attendance against people
that had signed up. We have since changed to <a
href="http://madrid.impacthub.net/">Impact HUB Madrid</a>, where they
don‚Äôt require us to control attendance. We have had many offers from
nice venues that required varying degrees of attendance controls: some
even wanted us to collect national card numbers. For us it has always
been a deal breaker. We are all volunteers, and devoting time to things
that do not benefit the community is not how we want to spend our
evenings.</p>
<p>Then there is also the issue of justified absences: some people may
fail to attend because they are sick, or have a work meeting. Do you
really want to request medical certificates or notes from your boss? Of
course, the point of penalizing misses is deterrence: the hope that
people will show up more often if there is a threat of being expelled,
even if it never happens in practice. But frankly, a community that
expels people that fail to show up is not one we want to belong to.</p>
<p>We have tried annoucing meetups late, but it did not appear to
improve the situation. And not streaming or recording is a disservice to
the community; even if it improved attendance, it is not something we
want to do!</p>
<h2 id="a-new-point-of-view">A New Point of View</h2>
<p>Let us approach the situation as an Internet-era issue.</p>
<h3 id="attendance-funnel">Attendance Funnel</h3>
<p>You have a pool of possible users, you want them to do two successive
tasks: first sign up, and then attend your event. Therefore you set up a
<em>funnel</em> and count the number of users that go from each step to
the next, measuring the <em>conversion ratio</em>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/funnel.png"
title="Funnel for attendance, a lot sign up, a few attend"
alt="Attendance Funnel" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Attendance Funnel</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The situation is very similar to an e-commerce shopping cart: users
come to your site, some of them add things to the cart, and then a few
actually buy anything.</p>
<p>The problem now becomes: how do you increase the conversion rate?</p>
<h3 id="proposals-revisited">Proposals Revisited</h3>
<p>Now let us review the proposals from CLSxMadrid with this new
mindset. Imagine that to increase sales at an online store, you decide
to charge ‚Ç¨1 to everyone that uses your virtual shopping cart, and then
give it back <strong>only to those that actually buy anything</strong>.
Do you think it would be successful?</p>
<p>That is the kind of strategy that not even a stuffy department-store
manager at a physical store would find acceptable: imagine what it would
to sales if the token ‚Ç¨1 deposit for a real shopping cart was only
returned to people that buy something? To anyone with half a clue it
looks really poorly thought. Prevent people from using a virtual
shopping cart, which doesn‚Äôt cost you anything?</p>
<p>You <em>really</em> do not want to do anything that decreases the
broad opening of the funnel. In our case, it is not a good idea to limit
the number of people that sign up, and you have better think twice
before <em>reducing the community</em> by expelling inconstant members!
Instead, you want to study why your conversion rate is so low.</p>
<h3 id="conversion-rates">Conversion Rates</h3>
<p>The obvious way is to charge for events: once people have paid for
something they are sure to attend. But unless you are TED Talks, good
luck bringing people to your events. <strong>The only way to increase
conversion rate would seem to be to make events more interesting,
meetups more engaging, and talks more inspiring.</strong> Then again, I
bet you are already doing all that already!</p>
<p>With this new point of view, a conversion rate of 30 to 50% is not
bad. Many online shops would sell their souls for a 20%. So anyway, what
is the problem of having people not show up?</p>
<h3 id="empty-chairs">Empty Chairs</h3>
<p>If you have ever organized an event, you probably know the story:
there are 80 seats in the venue, so you open up 80 reservations which
fill up in a few hours (or minutes). In the end only 40 people show up,
leaving 40 empty chairs.</p>
<p>This used to be our daily bread in MadridJS, where the venue forced
us to limit and control attendance. In Node.js Madrid we often meet at
<a href="http://kunlabori.es/">KUNlabori</a>, where the good owners
allowed us more freedom. So we started experimenting. First we tried
opening up 50% more reservations than seats. Better, but not good
enough: with 120 reservations 60 people showed up, leaving 20 empty
chairs. Next we decided to increase reservations to twice the number of
seats; paradoxically, this would create an artificial pressure on
reservations so they filled up quickly, and the conversion rate would
<em>fall</em> to about 30%.</p>
<p>Threatening to kill adorable baby animals if people failed to show up
did not work for us either. The next logical step was to stop limiting
attendance altogether. This has worked really well for us: no more empty
chairs while people complain that they could not make a reservation.</p>
<h3 id="dying-from-success">Dying From Success</h3>
<p>So, what happens if your event is so successful that there are more
people than seats? Just let people stand up!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we do not want to cause trouble to those kind
people lending us their venues for free. So if the place is limited to X
people, just limit attendance to the first X people that show up. This
may not look fair to those that registered in the first place, but
arriving late is not very polite either: this can be a good way to
ensure that everyone tries to make it on time.</p>
<p>The alternatives are, again, to control and limit attendance; and we
do not want to do that. Limiting reservations on Meetup.com or any
similar platform is no good unless someone checks that everybody has
signed up. So we prefer to let everyone sign up, and then deal with
attendance on the spot.</p>
<p>The worst that can happen is that you, the organizer, have to turn
people back because the venue is full; and to be honest, that is not
something that happens often. We had this issue with the first <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Node-js-Madrid/events/220356931/">NodeSchool
Madrid</a>: the canteen at <a href="http://medialab-prado.es/">Medialab
Prado</a> could only fit 120 people and about 140 showed up, so we just
turned the last 20 to other rooms in the same building (which is open to
the public anyway).</p>
<p>If you organize free events run by volunteers, people will probably
be nice to you even if they cannot get in. Just be sure to let them know
beforehand what the conditions are. If your biggest problem is that you
have too many people come at your events, then you are not in a bad
place! <a
href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstworldproblems">#firstworldproblems</a></p>
<h3 id="upcoming-events">Upcoming Events</h3>
<p>So, we will see what happens with our next meetups. In Node.js Madrid
we are doing a <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Node-js-Madrid/events/226495441/">round
table with Java devs</a> with 287 reservations, plus 104 on the <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/MadridJUG/events/227474197/">MadridJUG</a>
side. Luckily we have booked the brand-new <a
href="https://www.campus.co/madrid/es/about#main-event-space">Campus
Madrid</a> with space for 204 people, which should be enough.</p>
<p>In MadridJS, our upcoming <a
href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/227302060/">functional
programming workshop</a> has 142 people signed up for 25 places, again
in Campus Madrid but this time in the <a
href="https://www.campus.co/madrid/es/about#classroom">classroom</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: everything went perfectly with both events.
For the round table about 190 people showed up, out of the 204 places.
As to the functional programming workshop, we had 25 places and 20
people showed up, with 396 more following the event on streaming
video.</p>
<p>Even if next time we have to turn people back, we will be very lucky
to count with so many people willing to come to our events. So see you
at our next Meetup!</p>
