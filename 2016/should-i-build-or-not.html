<h2 id="the-story-for-managers">The Story for Managers</h2>
<p>Before we start, let us clear the air.</p>
<p>I am not going to present a boring list of bullet points to help you decide if you want to build a custom solution for your particular situation or not. Why? Very simple: because I do not know your particular situation, or even what factors are important in your case.</p>
<p>Just run a detailed Total Cost of Ownership comparison. And then throw it away, because you will probably have left out some of the most important factors in the equation.</p>
<h2 id="some-case-studies">Some Case Studies</h2>
<h3 id="continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</h3>
<h3 id="elb-balancer">ELB Balancer</h3>
<h2 id="emotional-arguments">Emotional Arguments</h2>
<p>I am a firm believer in rational thought: thinking things over objectively is our best tool at our disposition.</p>
<p>But there is only so much that can be explained rationally. Many of our best impulses are led more by intuition than by an explicit mental process, and are only rationalized after the fact.</p>
<p>A discussion of emotional arguments should allow us to recognize our unconscious biases, and hopefully to offset them.</p>
<h3 id="the-joy-of-building-things">The Joy of Building Things</h3>
<p>In his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Existential-Pleasures-Engineering-Thomas-Dunne/dp/0312141041">The Existential Pleasures of Engineering</a>, Florman argues that people build things just because they love to. He goes back to the wonderful Iliad searching for proofs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Homer insists on telling us how each object is made. [...] In more than 130 lines of poetry the fabrication and decoration of the fabulous shield is described. At other points in the story we are told in detail about the manufacture of Pandora's bow, Hera's chariot, Odysseus' bed, and Achylles' shelter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pleasure can still be felt in our veins each time we start a green field project: open a new blank document, initialize a git repo or just start sketching on a napkin in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Over at the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA">Primitive Technology</a>, with almost 1.5 million subscribers, a mysterious <a href="https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/about/">Australian guy</a> builds all kinds of things just using natural elements: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiHojsMTBeA">baskets and stone hatchet</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLoukoBs8TE">bow and arrow</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P73REgj-3UE">a complete hut</a>. This last video has over 8 million visualizations; we can only presume that most of them do not come from survivalists intent on imitating him, but just people that watch his handicrafts out of pure pleasure.</p>
<p>But is our joy a valid argument to make a business decision? You tell me; in this day of difficult engineer retention, a worthy project can make the difference to keep the good people. On the other hand, if you want to start an online shop, building your own compiler may be hard to justify. So we must keep on looking for other reasons.</p>
<h3 id="nih-syndrome">NIH Syndrome</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3338791">Not-Invented-Here Syndrome</a> is the vilification of a tendency to distrust products offered by third parties.</p>
<p>There is a lively discussion at <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NotInventedHere">the c2.com wiki</a> with pros and cons. Joel Spolsky, cofounder of Trello and Stack Overflow, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html">summarizes it thus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is a core business function -- do it yourself, no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I worked for 6 years in the banking sector. Most banks in Spain insist on trying to outsource their IT competencies, since they are not technology companies. But are they not? I contend that, in this day and age, banks are just purveyors of information: handling physical money is anecdotal and incidental to their business. Bank accounts and most financial products are just bits that move around. So, why should not banks embrace information technology?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology">FinTech</a> becomes both a hot sector and a buzzword, it is becoming apparent that traditional banks can and should do more with technology, or they risk going the way of record stores and Symbian phones.</p>
<h3 id="reinventing-the-wheel">Reinventing the Wheel</h3>
<p>You are probably now thinking that this way of reasoning leads straight to constant reinvention of basic tools. Well, there is a reason why people that start programming write their very own implementation of &quot;Hello, world&quot;: to learn how things work.</p>
<p>Wheels come in many shapes and colors. Tesla gives you the option to upgrade the model S with <a href="http://shop.teslamotors.com/collections/model-s-wheels-tires-and-tire-covers/products/21-arachnid-wheel-and-tire-package">four 21&quot;&quot; Arachnid Wheels</a> priced at $7,600; for that money you can buy a small car. I cannot imagine that when their engineers set to build an outstanding set of wheels, their manager told them not to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;.</p>
<p>So reinventing the wheel is not a valid rational argument, although it may reach the pit of your stomach since it is a highly emotional subject.</p>
<h2 id="a-most-welcome-third-way">A Most Welcome Third Way</h2>
<p>Are we stuck in an endless loop of emotional arguments, with no rational way out?</p>
<h3 id="customizable-solutions">Customizable Solutions</h3>
<p>There is a middle ground between building a new product and just installing a third party tool.</p>
<p>SAP offers .</p>
<h3 id="free-software">Free Software</h3>
<p>Due to a long membership to the FSFE, and out of respect for the great Richard Stallman, I resist using the term &quot;open source&quot;, so I will just offer it here as a practical synonym.</p>
