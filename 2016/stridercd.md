As you may know I work full time for MediaSmart Mobile,
but I also work as a freelancer for other people.
Usually as a scalability consultant,
although I also work in other areas
such as continuous deployment.
This gives me the opportunity to know other interesting projects,
and quite often to use cool new products.

## The Project

My friend [Diego Lafuente](https://twitter.com/tufosa)
asked me to help him in
[TaxiTime](http://taxitime.com),
an interesting taxicab aggregator from
[HotelBeds](http://www.hotelbeds.com/home).
