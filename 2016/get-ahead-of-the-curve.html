<p>So you want to become a better developer? This <a
href="becoming-a-better-developer">guide</a> is divided into four parts.
The previous installment was about <a
href="advice-for-the-novice">working as a junior</a>, while the third
(the one in your hands right now) is devoted to developers that have
certain experience and want to improve.</p>
<p>Tips to help you improve are shown <strong>in bold</strong>.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
Personal experiences will appear in colored boxes like this one.
</p>
<h2 id="devotion">Devotion</h2>
<p>Now let us consider the next step. You have been in the industry for
a few years, and you want to become a better developer.</p>
<p>At this delicate juncture we must search our souls once again. Do you
have the level of devotion needed to be, not just a regular software
developer, but a really good one? Do you want to be at the top of your
profession? Because honestly, you do not need to be: there are many
people with an honest development job that are happy to punch a clock
and do their time.</p>
<p>And then there are these people who do a lot of extra effort to look
beyond what is asked from them, and learn new things every day.</p>
<p><strong>Never despise great developers; never despise good
developers; never despise regular workers.</strong></p>
<p>I guess you can say it shorter: never despise other people for doing
their job as best they can.</p>
<h2 id="impostor-syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</h2>
<p>Perhaps you think you are a mediocre developer. Let me introduce you
to this little concept called <a
href="https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor">impostor
syndrome</a>, which some say is <a
href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_ladder/2016/04/is_impostor_syndrome_real_and_does_it_affect_women_more_than_men.html">not
even a syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>Basically it means that you feel that you are not adequate at your
work, even though external measures say you should. It is often felt by
people of all conditions, especially high achievers. Albert Einstein <a
href="http://therebegiants.com/overcoming-impostor-syndrome/">famously
said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exaggerated esteem in which my lifework is held makes me very ill
at ease. I feel compelled to think of myself as an involuntary
swindler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the most celebrated physicist in the 20th century was not immune
to impostor syndrome, how can you expect to overcome it? I recommend
focusing on two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you don’t have to tell others how good or bad you
<em>think</em> you are; just tell them what you have accomplished and
let them draw their own conclusions. In time this will allow you to
focus on results instead of on how good you are or are not.</li>
<li>And then you can just work hard. Don’t give yourself a heart attack
or spend your life on the keyboard; just do your best at whatever you
do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, what if you really are mediocre? Even if you feel you are below
average, you can improve a lot in our profession just by working hard
and focusing on results.</p>
<p><strong>Give a chance to mediocre people. Especially to
yourself.</strong></p>
<h2 id="so-are-you-good-already">So Are You Good Already?</h2>
<p>According to a popular notion, one half of everything is below
average. Wrong! This is only true if:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality can be measured,</li>
<li>and it follows a Gaussian distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us put aside the first item for a moment. The second condition is
not just a fine point: many important variables follow highly skewed
distributions.</p>
<p>Let me give you just one example. Household income is one of these
highly skewed quantities that do not follow a Gaussian curve.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/income-median.png"
title="Distribution is highly skewed to the left."
alt="Income distribution in the UK (2014/15). Source: Households Below Average Income." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Income distribution in the UK (2014/15).
Source: <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/532416/households-below-average-income-1994-1995-2014-2015.pdf">Households
Below Average Income</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to the quoted report by the <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-199495-to-201415">UK
Department for Work and Pensions</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2014/15 just under two-thirds of individuals had a household
income less than the national mean average (£581 per week).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprise! Not one half below average, but two-thirds! Perhaps
developer quality is similarly skewed.</p>
<p>Going back to the first condition brings us to an uncomfortable
question: can we even measure developer quality?</p>
<h2 id="the-10x-engineer">The 10x Engineer</h2>
<p>Fred Brooks writes in the classic “The Mythical Man-Month”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one of their studies, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant were measuring
performances of a group of experienced programmers. Within just this
group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1
on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and
space measurements!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a
href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0645438">the original
study</a>.</p>
<p>DeMarco and Lister found huge differences in productivity in an
inter-company competition.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>See how most people are below the average? Gradually managers
realized that there were huge differences in productivity between
developers.</p>
<p>From this emerged the figure of the 10x engineer: a person which is
able to do 10 times as much work as the regular developer.</p>
<h2 id="your-comfort-zone">Your “Comfort Zone”</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the #@&amp;! would I want to leave my comfort zone? Do these
people even know what “comfort” means?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of excellent resources about how to become an
excellent developer. I particularly like <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0TFmdO4ZP0">Angelina Fabbro’s
talk</a>. It contains excellent concrete advice, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn a new language,</li>
<li>use a new framework for your next pet project,</li>
<li>or read books about your profession.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
A common request from workers at most companies I know is: “we want more
training”. It has always amazed me: how come companies are not willing
to train their workers? That is a cheap request to make; in exchange
they would get a better and more motivated workforce. But quite often
those requests are not met.
</p>
<p>If your company is not giving you training, look for it yourself. Get
them to pay for interesting courses and conferences, or at least to give
you time off so you can attend. If they don’t, consider other jobs. But
while you are there, consider taking holidays for these activities.</p>
<p><strong>Your career is your responsibility, not your
company’s.</strong></p>
<h2 id="trust-me-im-an-engineer">Trust Me, I’m An Engineer</h2>
<p>“Engineer” is in many countries a prestigious title, <a
href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/engineer#Etymology">derived</a>
from latin <em>ingenium</em> (cleverness).</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>programmer</em> is tasked with writing a program, supposedly
starting with a detailed specification.</li>
<li>A <em>developer</em> has wider responsibilities: create a software
system that solves a certain problem.</li>
<li>An <em>engineer</em> is tasked with devising a solution to a
necessity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all solutions involve writing code. Sometimes it is better to
adapt an existing package, or just to hack up a simple console script
that does 80% of what we want. And sometimes the best solution is to
write some code.</p>
<p>But other times the best course is to delete code. As Ken Thompson <a
href="http://quotes.cat-v.org/programming/">once said</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of
code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always remember: writing software is a means to an end, not a goal in
itself.</p>
<p><strong>Strive to create value, not just to write
software.</strong></p>
<h2 id="find-your-specialty">Find Your Specialty</h2>
<p>You cannot be a top developer by just being a generalist. Luckily
there are many disciplines inside software engineering. A few of them
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>UX,</li>
<li>data science,</li>
<li>security,</li>
<li>scalability,</li>
<li>management,</li>
<li>development methodology,</li>
<li>gaming,</li>
<li>DevOps,</li>
<li>embedded systems,</li>
<li>physics simulation,</li>
<li>visualization,</li>
<li>quality assurance,</li>
<li>mobile apps,</li>
<li>machine learning,</li>
<li>analytics,</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting thrown into the wrong specialty can be very damaging.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
In 2007 I joined ING Direct Spain as an analyst, which involved a lot of
technical work and some programming. As I have told <a
href="mib-five-years-later">elsewhere</a>, a couple of years later I was
made a project manager, which means that I was supposed to use an office
suite as my tool of choice, and <em>not code anymore</em>. My life was
not easy from that point on. While it is nice to know how to manage
people, resources and projects, I’m not comfortable in a 100% managerial
position. After a couple of years I left and have done technical work
since.
</p>
<p><strong>Find what discipline you you would like to specialize in, and
strive to work in it.</strong></p>
<p>Your knowledge should be T-shaped: a shallow familiarity with many
disciplines, and deep understanding of one or two.</p>
<p>It is probably a good idea not to specialize too much: an “expert in
jQuery” looked great five years ago, but nowadays it looks dated.
Instead, focus on broad disciplines like frontend development or UX
(which is itself a refactoring of UI).</p>
<h2 id="get-involved-in-the-community">Get Involved In The
Community</h2>
<p>Finally, a really good way to improve as a software engineer is to
find a local community, and get involved. Just showing up is a great
first step! Then you can stay for a couple of sodas afterwards. It is
very rewarding to know more people that work in your field and exchange
stories from the trenches. Talking with your colleagues from work is
nice, but since you breathe the same environment it is not as
interesting.</p>
<p>The next step is to attend a few conferences, both at the national
and international level. This way you can broaden your circle of
acquaintances: most people are quite open at conferences and are usually
willing to speak to anyone during breaks.</p>
<p>Then you can try giving a talk at a local group, and seeing if people
like it.</p>
<p style="color:#636; border:thin solid #c9c">
In 2012 I approached the organizers of MadridJS to propose a talk about
Node.js and Websockets, something I had been working on in my spare time
as part of the <a
href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/milliearth">milliearth</a>
project I have mentioned before. We finally scheduled it in 2013. All
the 70 available places in Meetup were gone in about four minutes, which
goes to show how popular the subject was. It was <a
href="https://vimeo.com/62771422">unfortunately taped (in Spanish)</a>.
You can see how nervous I was. Even so it was a great experience! Since
then I have been involved in MadridJS, and today I help organize monthly
talks.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many ways to improve as a developer, many of them have been
repeated <em>ad nauseam</em> by now, while others are clearly not
stressed enough.</p>
<p>To really improve you need a long-term goal; it will help you
focus.</p>
<p><strong>Set yourself a goal for the next five years, and then build a
way to get there.</strong></p>
<p>Your goal should not be something too specific, like “mastering
Angular”: in five years it might not be that interesting (or it might
not even exist). Instead of a project, a framework or a company, try
focusing on a particular discipline, and work from there.</p>
