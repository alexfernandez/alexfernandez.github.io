										<h1>🌐 Floating Around the World in under 80 Days</h1>
										<p>With Avis LXXX: an Autonomous Airship Drone<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Is it possible to complete a trip around the world with an autonomous
drone? And under 80 days? Today we will explore this crazy project that
would make <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days">Jules
Verne proud</a>. And we will figure out if it can be done with a
relatively modest budget. Like, say, one million euros.</p>

</figure>
<h1 id="the-project">The Project</h1>
<p>For starters let’s review how crazy the idea is by answering a few
questions that may be popping into your head.</p>
<p><strong>How fast does it need to go?</strong> First, we want to build
a flying device that can autonomously circumnavigate the world in less
than 80 days. If it went on a straight line around the equator the trip
would take 40,000 km, or 25,000 miles; in 80 days average speed comes
out as a little bit over 20 km/h (13 miles/hour). In what follows we
will use meters per second; so 6 m/s will be our minimum speed target.
Let’s make it 10 m/s to have some room.</p>
<p><strong>Can we make flight more efficient?</strong> The biggest
energy expense for a drone is usually not moving about, but staying up
in the air. For our little project it will need to keep running for many
weeks. One solution I’m particularly fond of is making the aircraft
buoyant on its own. An airship can remain afloat as long as it holds its
lighter-than-air gas inside. The obvious solution is to propel the drone
using electric batteries, and replenish the power during the day using
high efficiency solar panels.</p>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8dXDgt0iCg">YouTube video from
eBlimp</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>What is the best option for the gas inside the
airship?</strong> Helium is the usual choice, but for a drone where no
human lives are endangered it may not be optimal. Hydrogen is cheaper,
lighter and more readily available. Any risk of conflagration can be
mitigated by careful construction.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of enclosure is needed to hold the gas inside for
11 weeks?</strong> This was solved more than a century ago with clever
construction, and modern materials make it even easier. Construction can
be made strong and resilient while keeping it light. There are
readily-available polymers with low hydrogen permeability such as PVA or
EVOH, and they can be supplemented with other layers that prevent
ultraviolet damage and weather corrosion.</p>
<p><strong>How big does the airship need to be?</strong> Ship size is a
critical parameter. A small drone is easier and cheaper to build, while
bigger ships tends to have higher top speeds. Having enough
instrumentation onboard also requires to carry a minimum payload. We
will set a target length of 4 meters and check if it works.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>what is the best route to take?</strong> An airship
can also helped by trade winds: air currents caused by the rotation of
the Earth that move on average from East to West. The trajectory should
therefore follow this orientation rather than West-East. A modestly
sized airship cannot go against strong air currents, so the path should
be carefully planned in advance and adjusted while in flight, to take
advantage of the wind at every point.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Most of the trajectory can pass over the oceans, but skipping land
completely would take too much of a detour, and likely be incompatible
with prevailing winds. Although the political climate may be hostile, it
is still legal to fly civil craft over other countries. The challenge
here is to find some convenient low-hostility routes for safe
passage.</p>
<h2 id="concept">💡 Concept</h2>
<p>The inspiration for reliable hydrogen airships is quite old. More
than a century ago the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo came up
with the <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348018483_Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo_1902-1908_The_Foundations_for_100_years_of_Airship_designs">Astra
Torres designs</a>, autorigid dirigibles which were used successfully in
the Great War. Unlike the competition from German Zeppelins and others,
these hydrogen monsters had no flammability issues at all during their
long career, due to careful design and construction.</p>

<p>Solar panel advances are very well exemplified by the Airbus Zephyr,
now run by its own company <a
href="https://www.aaltohaps.com/">AALTO</a>. In 2025 it endured <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flight_endurance_records#Airplane,_uncrewed">67
days of autonomous powered flight</a>, recharging during the day and
hovering during the night. The efficiency obtained by their batteries
and solar panels is awesome, and there are now consumer products in the
same range.</p>

<h1 id="the-craft">🛩️ The Craft</h1>
<p>Let’s now review the details concerning airship design and
construction. Keep in mind that everything we say here will be a bit
handwavy, just intended for a very preliminary feasibility study. A
large part of the project is proper engineering research into how to
make the project work reliably, and how to fly autonomously for
weeks.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>
<p>Thanks to the latest advances in miniaturization a drone can be quite
small, while still being fully functional. We will set a target size of
4 meters, which we have previously analyzed in <a
href="http://pinchito.local/2024/aves-aeternae">Aves Æternæ</a>. Minor
axes are 2 meters long; surface is 21.48 m2 while volume is 8.38 m3.
This gives us a max weight of less than 10 kg. We will review and update
these specs for the trip around the world.</p>
<p>How much gas do we need for this mission? A spheroid of 4x2x2 m3 will
use around 560 grams of hydrogen, which occupies 8 m3 of gas, or 8000
liters. This may seem like a lot, but it is almost exactly the contents
of a <a
href="https://shop.airproducts.com/emea/es/es-ES/products/62242/">commercial
hydrogen cylinder</a>.</p>
<h2 id="outer-shell">Outer Shell</h2>
<p>The airship cover needs to keep its shape and endure the elements;
while being light enough to stay within spec. I previously assumed that
a carbon fiber skin was the best option. This was a bit misguided: the
material is too rigid, too opaque and not resistant enough to withstand
the elements. A composite skin of different polymers seems like a much
better option, with an external exoskeleton of carbon fiber to keep its
shape.</p>
<p>The exact composition needs to be studied, but it must deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tensile strength: be able to withstand strong winds and changes of
pressure. Polyurethane seems to be a good choice.</li>
<li>Ultraviolet damage: keep up with the strong sun near the
equator.</li>
<li>Water resistance: endure rain for extended periods.</li>
</ul>
<p>To build the outer shell we need to join a number of pieces with
funny shapes. I did some numerical integration for the <a
href="/2024/avis-minima">Avis Minima</a> project, to find how to divide
an airship into four planar segments. These pieces can be joined
together using ultrasonic plastic sealing, which is much more effective
than traditional sewing techniques.</p>
<p>I have found that it is a good compromise to use around half the
weight of the airship for the external envelopes. Preliminary numbers
show that 3 kg should be enough for the outer shell; for our surface of
21.5 m3 we get an areal density of 140 g/m2. If you know your paper
qualities, this would be equivalent to thin cardboard. For light
polymers that have a density around 1 g/cm3, this gives us a thickness
of 0.185 mm.</p>
<h2 id="hydrogen-gas">Hydrogen Gas</h2>
<p>Additionally, a gas bag will be needed to hold the hydrogen for
extended periods. Judging by the literature a target of 1% leakage per
week is quite doable. For instance in <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317394151_Self-Sustainability_in_Nano_Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicles_A_Blimp_Case_Study">this
article</a>, or <a
href="https://www.publi-zeppelines.com/preguntas-frecuentes-hinchables-helio-publicitarios">this
commercial provider</a> that advertises 2% helium loss per week.</p>
<p>Losing 1% per week for 11.5 weeks (80 days) would leave us with 11.5%
less gas at the end of our little trip, which can compromise buoyancy by
reducing lift by more than a kilogram. Smaller leakages or a shorter
trip (see below) may be necessary. Keep in mind that hydrogen is a
smaller <em>atom</em> than helium, but a bigger <em>molecule</em> as
there are two atoms. I have not seen a definitive answer on which gas is
easier to contain, but there have been considerable efforts to contain
hydrogen since it is used widely in industrial settings. It seems that
polymers such as PVA or EVOH are best suited for containing it.</p>
<p>We should be able to spare 1 kg for the gas bag; again for our
surface of 21.5 m3 we get an areal density of 47 g/m2. This corresponds
with very light wrapping paper or thin supermarket bags. Since PVA is
1.19 g/cm3, this gives us a thickness of around 40 microns, which is
common in the industry.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>We also need a strong carbon fiber structure to keep everything in
place. We will reserve 1 kg for a few strips of carbon fiber around the
structure, three little wings (one on top and two on the sides, and a
nose cone. The strips are aproximately 26.5 meters long, if maths serve
me right; making them 0.5 kg would give a length density of 18 g/m,
although it is probably better to make the top strips lighter and the
bottom strips sturdier. The wings and the nose cone are a bit over a
square meter, so an areal density of 500 g/m2 seems appropriate.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the structure can be made lighter to save
even more weight.</p>
<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>Our target speed of 10 m/s requires some serious power. With the drag
coefficient of 0.03 computed in <a href="/2024/aves-aeternae">Aves
Æternæ</a> we get a general formula of:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ ½ 1.3 kg/m³ × 0.03 × 3 m² × v³,
P ≈ 0.06 kg/m × v³,</code></pre>
<p>So in order to reach 10 m/s we need:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ 0.06 × 10³ W,
P ≈ 60 W.</code></pre>
<p>Let’s set aside a power target of 165W, so we can drive our motors
while charging the batteries at the same time. Using commercially
available solar cells 224 W/m2 is currently achievable, with a weight of
384 g/m2 (cells only). We can reach our target of 165W with an area of
0,73 m2. Building a solar panel requires giving them some support,
protection from the elements and electric connections; let’s suppose a
total density of 1 kg/m2. Just to be safe we will use a flexible panel
of 1 m2 weighing 1 kg, which should fit comfortably on top of the drone.
This gives us the full 224 Watt.</p>
<p>And we may as well need this kind of power. Power requirements grow
with the 3rd power of the speed, which is a lot. What happens if we use
the full power to run the motors? 224W with an efficiency of 90% would
allow us to reach peak speeds of 15 m/s (54 km/h or 34 mi/h):</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ 0.06 × 15³ ≈ 202 W.</code></pre>
<p>This could be used for emergency situations or to counteract strong
winds. Maximum power is only reached with full-on sun, which is a couple
of hours per day max, so we need some margin. And 90% efficiency may be
a bit optimistic.</p>
<p>Storing all this energy can be costly. Energy density for LiPo
batteries can reach 200 Wh/kg, so if we use a 1 kg battery we can store
up to 200 Wh. This would take a couple of hours to recharge if we can
spare 100 W. At night it would be able to give 20 W for ten hours, which
would result in a speed of around 6 m/s.</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ 0.06 × 6³ ≈ 13 W.</code></pre>
<p>Depending on how many hours of direct sunlight we get, our little
airship might be making around 500 km every day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day: 10 m/s for 8 hours = 288 km.</li>
<li>Night: 6 m/s for 10 hours = 216 km.</li>
<li>Total: 288 + 216 = 504 km.</li>
</ul>
<p>So even without wind we are almost at 80 days around the equator!</p>
<h2 id="completing-the-build">Completing the Build</h2>
<p>Some years ago it would have been hard to find lightweight motors and
propellers for a smallish airship such as Avis Lxxx. Luckily for us,
drones exist! Nowadays we can get awesome combinations of motor +
propeller that weigh less than 50 grams, bringing the total weight to
100 grams. For instance this <a
href="https://amaxshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=1801">brushless
motor</a> weighs 37g and can give as much as 270 Watts, while <a
href="https://www.fpv24.com/en/hq-prop/hqprop-7x35x3-racing-prop-fpv-3-blade-propeller-7-inch-light-grey">these
propellers</a> are just 8.8g.</p>
<p>Navigation computer and communications equipment can be similarly
miniaturized, and again can be below 100 grams. Both can live inside the
gondola where they are protected. What about the gondola itself? The
bottom does not need to be particularly strong since it will just hold
the weight of the battery and electronics. The sides will hold motors +
propellers, with enough distance to avoid hitting the enclosure. I am
envisioning a boat-like structure with a length of 30 ~ 50 cm, a width
of 20 ~ 30 cm, and height of ~ 10 cm. Hopefully it can be lightened to
around 100 grams.</p>
<p>We also need a certain length of cable to connect the solar panel to
the battery: around 6 meters, which is the perimeter of the enclosure at
its equator. 16 awg cable (&lt; 100 grams) should be enough.</p>
<h2 id="weight-budget">Weight Budget</h2>
<p>So our weight budget is at this point:</p>

<p>An 8 kg airship will certainly be able to hover. Remember that lift
is due to the volume of air displaced by the hydrogen, so with 8.38 m3
lift will be:</p>
<pre><code>L = 8.38 * (1.3 - 0.070) kg/m3 ~ 10.3 kg.</code></pre>
<p>So we still have more than 2 kg to go, right? But this is at sea
level with at unrealistic temperatures of 0 °C! As temperature raises
air becomes less dense, so we will get less and less lift:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tr class="odd">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Plus, the airship will have to go over land at some point, and keep a
certain height to have clearance. Air density goes down fast with
altitude: the <a
href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/international-standard-atmosphere-d_985.html">international
standard atmosphere</a> dictates that at 500 m it will be down 5%, so we
will have 0.95 of the lift: at 30 °C it’s only 8.65 kg. Our weight
budget is starting to get tight.</p>
<p>The last factor is hydrogen loss: even at 1% per week, after 80 days
there will be 12% less gas, and this space inside the enclosure will be
occupied by air. Lift at 500m and 30 °C is now down to 7.6 kg. In fact,
according to this <a
href="https://aerotoolbox.com/density-altitude/">handy density
calculator</a> our little airship would hardly be able to keep airborne!
So one of the challenges is to reduce hydrogen losses, or make a faster
trip, or save even a few grams here and there. At this point the weight
obsession of airship designers starts to be understandable.</p>
<h1 id="navigation">🗺️ Navigation</h1>
<p>What scenic routes will we take across our beautiful planet? We have
to consider a few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go as straight as possible.</li>
<li>Take advantage of winds.</li>
<li>Not get shot at.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="route">Route</h2>
<p>We might think that the best path is to go in a straight line curved
around the globe. The diameter of the equator is 40,000 km, and if we
just stay on the 40°N parallel it is even shorter: 30,000 km. But this
is not very efficient.</p>
<p>As we saw before we need the help of trade winds, which usually blow
from East to West. They can help us shorten flight time: average trade
wind speed is 5 m/s, which combined with our computed speeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day: 15 m/s for 8 hours = 432 km.</li>
<li>Night: 11 m/s for 10 hours = 396 km.</li>
<li>Total: 432 + 396 = 828 km per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much better than the 500 km per day we were getting before. If we
assume that our route is 50,000 km long, we would be in the air for 60
days, or under 9 weeks.</p>
<p>Head winds should not surpass 13 m/s if we want to be able to
counteract them. 49 km/h (30 mi/h) is not a lot, especially over sea.
The wonderful <a href="https://earth.nullschool.net/">nullschool earth
project</a> will help us a lot in this imaginary flight plan.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that wind conditions change all the time; we are

denser air.</p>
<p>We may as well start in Southern Spain, near Cádiz. The prevailing
winds will usually help us get to the Canary Islands</p>

<h2 id="height">Height</h2>
<p>The problem of height is one of the most interesting aspects of the
project. Go too high and the payload is reduced greatly; go too low and
any sudden change of temperature will drop the drone to the ground.</p>
<h2 id="communications">📡 Communications</h2>
<p>How can we get news from our trusty friend as it flies around the
globe? There are several intriguing possibilities which I have learned
about.</p>
<p>The first is LoRa, a wide area protocol.</p>
<p>The second is SigFox, which has <a
href="https://sigfox.com/coverage/">decent worldwide coverage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>It is <a
href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/skies-spies-and-scientific-surveys-the-legal-aspects-of-chinese-unmanned-balloon-flight-over-american-territory/">legal
to fly civilian aircraft</a>. In the EU you have to register drones over
8 kg, as is the case with the Avis Lxxx. It is however illegal to fly
drones over visual line-of-sight (VLOS): not keeping them in sight; or
to fly at a height above 120 m.</p>
<h1 id="trials">Trials</h1>
<p>A series of trials should establish if the Avis Lxxx is airworthy. It
is not enough to find a few parts on AliExpress and say that it can be
done: the actual airship will have to work reliably for weeks, and
hardened parts will need to be sourced (or fabricated).</p>
<h2 id="atlantic-trips">Atlantic Trips</h2>
<p>A convenient destination from Spain, where I’m located, is the Canary
Islands.</p>
<p>Another convenient destination is Canada. Canada has more lax
legislation than the EU: it is now legal to fly <a
href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety/2025-summary-changes-canada-drone-regulations">beyond
visual line-of-sight</a>.</p>
<h1 id="budget">Budget</h1>
<p>Can we put a number on the necessary budget for the Avis Lxxx? Let’s
start with a million dollars.</p>
<h2 id="material-cost">Material Cost</h2>
<p>Most of the materials required should be pretty cheap: PVA and other
plastic coatings,</p>
<p>Some equipment is not cheap: for instance ultrasonic sealing
machines.</p>
<p>Industrial hydrogen generators are another expensive bit. Keep in
mind that we need 8000 l of hydrogen; <a
href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/ES/en/product/supelco/27773u?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=20849931024&amp;utm_content=171133062889&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20849931024&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD8kLQSooOxhaQNNTw7C1mk9pG1qo&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA3-3KBhBiEiwA2x7FdIdq83GrfkYWAHQMJX2Vec1M8LdAbA6zCFy8CjAScFXqzHvZeR3gUhoCDmMQAvD_BwE">this
€10k hydrogen generator</a> would take 5+ days hours to fill our
enclosure.</p>
<p>On the other hand a commercial cylinder with 50 l (200 bar) costs <a
href="https://shop.airproducts.com/emea/es/es-ES/products/62242/">around
€130</a>, for a total of more than 8 m3, enough to fill one airship. So
we may rethink the need to generate our own hydrogen.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>Most of our funds are needed to investigate possible alternatives for
fabrication, and to ensure mission success.</p>
<h2 id="amateur-project">Amateur Project</h2>
<p>We often find on social media like YouTube really bright people that
create really complex projects on their own in a few months. So it is
possible that one of these geniuses will replicate this project on their
own with a budget of a few thousand euros. Why not? After all there are
no great obstacles to any clever maker who is sufficiently determined,
and enough of a fool to embark in such a crazy enterprise.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">🥺 Motivation</h2>
<p>Why pursue this project, at all? First, a kid can dream: thought
experiments have moved forward what is considered possible. After all,
the original story for “Around the World in 80 Days” is after all just
that, a thought experiment. Jules Verne did not do thetripp but just
imagined how it could be done.</p>
<p>Then there are the famed world records: Airbus Zephyr, the work of a
giant corporation, holds the current world record of air endurance with
67 days. Wouldn’t it be great to snatch it from their cold corporate
hands with an amateur project?</p>
<p>Plus, airships are super cool. Dreamers from Torres Quevedo to Hayao
Miyazaki to Google Founder <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250214-pathfinder-1-the-airship-that-could-usher-in-a-new-age">Sergei
Brin</a> have been seduced by them.</p>
<h2 id="previous-ideas">💡 Previous Ideas</h2>
<p>The original <a href="/2023/avis-aeterna">Avis Æterna</a> project
called for an autonomous semi-buoyant flying wing plane, which was later
refined to the <a href="/2024/aves-aeternae">Aves Æternæ</a> airship
drone. Later, the <a href="/2024/avis-minima">Avis Minima</a> project
studied how to build a 1-meter long airship.</p>
