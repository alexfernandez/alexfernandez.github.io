										<h1>🌐 Around the World in under 80 Days</h1>
										<p>Avis LXXX<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Is it possible to complete a trip around the world with an autonomous
drone? And under 80 days? This is a crazy project that would make <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days">Jules
Verne proud</a>. But the real fun is to figure out if it can be done
with a relatively modest budget of one million euros.</p>

<h1 id="the-project">The Project</h1>
<p>Before we go into the details, let’s review how crazy the idea is by
answering a few questions that may be popping into your head.</p>
<p><strong>How fast does it need to go?</strong> First, we want to build
a flying device that can autonomously circumnavigate the world in less
than 80 days. If it went on a straight line around the equator the trip
would take 40,000 km, or 25,000 miles; average speed comes out as a
little bit over 20 km/h (13 miles/hour). We will use meters per second
here, so will take 5 m/s as the initial speed target.</p>
<p><strong>Can we make flight more efficient?</strong> The biggest
energy expense for a drone is usually not moving about, but staying up
in the air. One solution I’m particularly fond of is making the aircraft
buoyant on its own. An airship can remain afloat as long as it holds its
lighter-than-air gas inside. For our little project it needs to keep
running for many weeks. The obvious solution is to propel the drone
using electric batteries, and replenish the power during the day using
high efficiency solar panels.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best option for the gas inside the
airship?</strong> Helium is the usual choice, but for a drone where no
human lives are endangered it may not be optimal. Hydrogen is cheaper,
lighter and more readily available. Any risk of conflagration can be
mitigated by careful construction.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of enclosure is needed to hold the gas inside for
11 weeks?</strong> This was solved more than a century ago with clever
construction, and modern materials have wonderful properties. There are
clever materials with low hydrogen permeability such as PVA or EVOH, and
can be layered with other polymers that prevent ultraviolet damage and
weather corrosion. Furthermore, construction can be made strong and
resilient while keeping it light.</p>
<p><strong>How big does the airship need to be?</strong> Ship size is a
critical parameter. A small ship is easier and cheaper to build, while
bigger ships tends to have higher top speeds. Having enough
instrumentation onboard also requires to carry a minimum payload. We
will set a target length of 4 meters and check if it works.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>what is the best route to take?</strong> An airship
can also helped by trade winds: air currents caused by the rotation of
the Earth, that move on average from East to West. The trajectory should
therefore follow this orientation rather than West-East. A modestly
sized airship cannot go against strong air currents, so the path should
be carefully planned in advance and adjusted while in flight, to take
advantage of the wind at every point.</p>
<p>Most of the trajectory can pass over the oceans, but skipping land
completely would take too much of a detour, and likely be incompatible
with prevailing winds. Although the political climate may be hostile, it
is still legal to fly civil craft over other countries. The challenge
here is to find some convenient low-hostility routes for safe
passage.</p>
<h2 id="concept">💡 Concept</h2>
<p>The inspiration for safe, hydrogen airships is quite old. More than a
century ago the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo came up with
the <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348018483_Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo_1902-1908_The_Foundations_for_100_years_of_Airship_designs">Astra
Torres designs</a>, autorigid dirigibles which were used successfully in
the Great War. Unlike the competition from the German Zeppelins and
others, these hydrogen crafts had no flammability issues at all during
their long career, due to careful design and construction.</p>

<p>Solar panel advances are very well exemplified by the Airbus Zephyr,
now run by its own company AALTO. In 2025 it endured <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flight_endurance_records#Airplane,_uncrewed">67
days of autonomous powered flight</a>, recharging during the day and
hovering during the night. The efficiency obtained by their batteries
and solar panels is awesome, and it has trickled down to consumer
products.</p>

<h1 id="the-craft">🛩️ The Craft</h1>
<p>Let’s now review the details concerning airship design and
construction.</p>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>
<p>Thanks to the latest advances in miniaturization a drone can be quite
small, while still being fully functioning.</p>
<h2 id="hydrogen-gas">Hydrogen Gas</h2>
<p>How much gas do we need for this mission? A spheroid of 4x2x2 m3 will
use around 560 grams of hydrogen, which occupies 8 m3 of gas, or 8000
liters. This is a lot.</p>
<h2 id="skin">Skin</h2>
<p>The airship cover needs to keep its hydrogen inside, endure the
elements and keep its shape; and do all this being light enough.</p>
<p>My original intention of building a carbon fiber skin was a bit
misguided: it’s too rigid, too opaque and not resistant enough to the
elements.</p>
<p>Nowadays ultrasonic plastic sealing is much more effective than
traditional sewing techniques.</p>
<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>Our target speed of 10 m/s requires some serious power. With the drag
coefficient of 0.03 computed in <a href="/2024/aves-aeternae">Aves
Æternæ</a> we get:</p>
<p>P ≈ 0.06 kg/m × v³, P ≈ 60 W.</p>
<p>Let’s set aside a power target of 165W, so we can drive our motors
while charging the batteries at the same time. Using commercially
available solar panels 224W/m2 is currently achievable, with a weight of
384 g/m2 (panels only). Building a solar cell requires giving them some
support, protection from the elements and electric connections; let’s
suppose a total weight of 1 kg/m2. We can reach our target of 165W with
an area of 0,73 m2, which means building a flexible panel of 730 grams.
This panel should fit comfortably on top of the drone.</p>
<p>Power requirements grow with the 3rd power of the speed, which is a
lot. What happens if we use the whole power to run the motors? 164W with
an efficiency of 90% would allow us to reach peak speeds of only 13.5
m/s (49 km/h or 30 mi/h):</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ 0.06 × 13.5³ ≈ 148 W.</code></pre>
<h2 id="payload">Payload</h2>
<p>Navigation computer, communications equipment and</p>

<h1 id="navigation">🗺️ Navigation</h1>
<h2 id="route">Route</h2>
<p>or 30,000 km on the 40°N parallel. The wonderful <a
href="https://earth.nullschool.net/">nullschool earth project</a></p>
<p>Head winds should not surpass 13 m/s if we want to be able to
counteract them. 49 km/h (30 mi/h) is not a lot, especially over
sea.</p>
<h2 id="height">Height</h2>
<p>The problem of height is one of the most interesting aspects of the
project. Go too high and the payload is reduced greatly; go too low and
any sudden change of temperature will drop the drone to the ground.</p>
<h2 id="communications">📡 Communications</h2>
<p>How can we get news from our trusty friend as it flies around the
globe? There are several intriguing possibilities which I have learned
about.</p>
<p>The first is LoRa, a wide area protocol.</p>
<p>The second is SigFox, which has <a
href="https://sigfox.com/coverage/">decent worldwide coverage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>It is <a
href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/skies-spies-and-scientific-surveys-the-legal-aspects-of-chinese-unmanned-balloon-flight-over-american-territory/">legal
to fly civilian aircraft</a>. In the EU you have to register drones over
8 kg, as is the case with the Avis Lxxx. It is however illegal to fly
drones over visual line-of-sight (VLOS): not keeping them in sight; or
to fly at a height above 120 m.</p>
<h1 id="trials">Trials</h1>
<p>A series of trials should establish if the Avis Lxxx is
airworthy.</p>
<h2 id="atlantic-trips">Atlantic Trips</h2>
<p>A convenient destination from Spain, where I’m located, is the Canary
Islands.</p>
<p>Another convenient destination is Canada. Canada has more lax
legislation than the EU: it is now legal to fly <a
href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety/2025-summary-changes-canada-drone-regulations">beyond
visual line-of-sight</a>.</p>
<h1 id="budget">Budget</h1>
<p>Can we put a number on the necessary budget for the Avis Lxxx? Let’s
start with a million dollars.</p>
<h2 id="material-cost">Material Cost</h2>
<p>Most of the materials required should be pretty cheap: PVA and other
plastic coatings,</p>
<p>Some equipment is not cheap: for instance ultrasonic sealing
machines.</p>
<p>Industrial hydrogen generators are another expensive bit. Keep in
mind that we need 8000 l of hydrogen; <a
href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/ES/en/product/supelco/27773u?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=20849931024&amp;utm_content=171133062889&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20849931024&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD8kLQSooOxhaQNNTw7C1mk9pG1qo&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA3-3KBhBiEiwA2x7FdIdq83GrfkYWAHQMJX2Vec1M8LdAbA6zCFy8CjAScFXqzHvZeR3gUhoCDmMQAvD_BwE">this
€10k hydrogen generator</a> would take 5+ days hours to fill our
enclosure.</p>
<p>On the other hand a commercial cylinder with 50 l (200 bar) costs <a
href="https://shop.airproducts.com/emea/es/es-ES/products/62242/">around
€130</a>, for a total of more than 8 m3, enough to fill one airship. So
we may rethink the need to generate our own hydrogen.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>Most of our funds are needed to investigate possible alternatives for
fabrication, and to ensure mission success.</p>
<h2 id="amateur-project">Amateur Project</h2>
<p>We often find on social media like YouTube really bright people that
create really complex projects on their own in a few months. So it is
possible that one of these geniuses will replicate this project on their
own with a budget of a few thousand euros. Why not? After all there are
no great obstacles to any clever maker who is sufficiently determined,
and enough of a fool to embark in such a crazy enterprise.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">🥺 Motivation</h2>
<p>Why pursue this project, at all? First, a kid can dream: thought
experiments have moved forward what is considered possible. After all,
the original story for “Around the World in 80 Days” is after all just
that, a thought experiment. Jules Verne did not do thetripp but just
imagined how it could be done.</p>
<p>Then there are the famed world records: Airbus Zephyr, the work of a
giant corporation, holds the current world record of air endurance with
67 days. Wouldn’t it be great to snatch it from their cold corporate
hands with an amateur project?</p>
<p>Plus, airships are super cool. Dreamers from Torres Quevedo to Hayao
Miyazaki to Google Founder <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250214-pathfinder-1-the-airship-that-could-usher-in-a-new-age">Sergei
Brin</a> have been seduced by them.</p>
<h2 id="previous-ideas">💡 Previous Ideas</h2>
<p>The original <a href="/2023/avis-aeterna">Avis Æterna</a> project
called for an autonomous semi-buoyant flying wing plane, which was later
refined to the <a href="/2024/aves-aeternae">Aves Æternæ</a> airship
drone. Later, the <a href="/2024/avis-minima">Avis Minima</a> project
studied how to build a 1-meter long airship.</p>
