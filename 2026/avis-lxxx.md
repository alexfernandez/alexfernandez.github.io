Is it possible to complete a trip around the world on an autonomous drone?
And under 80 days?
This is a crazy project that would make [Jules Verne proud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days).
And still seems doable with only a relatively modest budget.

# The Project

Before we go into the details, let's review how crazy the idea is.
We want to build a flying device that can autonomously circumnavigate the world in less than 80 days.
Best case distance is a bit under 40,000 km on the equator;
average speed comes out as a little bit over 5 m/s
(20 km/h, or 13 miles/hour).

The biggest energy expense for a drone is usually not moving about,
but keeping afloat;
so what if the aircraft is buoyant on its own?
An airship can remain afloat as long as it holds its lighter-than-air gas inside,
and it can be propelled by electric batteries.
High efficiency solar panels can replenish the power during the day.

Ship size is a critical parameter.
A small ship is easier and cheaper to build,
while bigger ships tends to have higher top speeds.

Hydrogen is a cheap gas, lighter than helium and more readily available.
Any risk of conflagration can be mitigated by careful construction.
Also, it's a drone so no human lives are endangered should the worst happen.

Is it even possible to hold the gas for 11 weeks?
What kind of enclosure do we need?
There are clever composite materials with low hydrogen permeability,
with layers of materials such as PVA or EVOH.
Ultraviolet damage and weather corrosion must be prevented by careful construction;
nothing that hasn't been done before, and modern materials have wonderful properties.

Another consideration is what route to take.
An airship can also helped by trade winds:
air currents that move on average from East to West,
caused by the rotation of the Earth.
The trajectory should therefore follow this orientation rather than West-East.
A modestly sized airship cannot go against strong air currents for long,
so careful planning must be needed to take advantage of the wind at every point.

Most of the trajectory can pass over the oceans,
but skipping land completely would take too much of a detour
(and possibly be incompatible with prevailing winds).
Although the political climate may be hostile,
it is still legal to fly civil craft over other countries.

# 🛩️ The Craft

Thanks to the latest advances in miniaturization

The original [Avis Æterna](/2023/avis-aeterna) project called for an autonomous semi-buoyant flying wing plane,
which was later refined to the
[Aves Æternæ](/2024/aves-aeternae)
airship drone.

## Hydrogen Gas

## Skin

The airship cover needs to keep its hydrogen inside,
to endure the elements and do all this being light enough.

## Politics


# 🤔 Conclusion

Having a set of rules to help us make decisions is important to keep our sanity
in these turbulent times.
They may help our judgement, but will never replace it.
