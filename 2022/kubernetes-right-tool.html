                    </figure>
                    <p>I read today an interesting article by Jeremy Brown: <a href="https://www.jeremybrown.tech/8-kubernetes-is-a-red-flag-signalling-premature-optimisation/">Kubernetes is a red flag signalling premature optimisation</a>. I would like to explain in this article our experience at <a href="">Hivency</a>, where we have used Kubernetes extensively.</p>
                    <p><a href="">Hivency</a> is an influencer marketing company that was recently acquired by the <a href="">Skeepers group</a>.</p>
                    <p>for us for example. kubernetes migration have been done like 2 year after my arrival i think. so not at the beginning. and it was the logical continuation of what we used at AWS (Elasticbean Stalk, a ready to use solution for managing VM with load balancer). So not a premature optimization at all. Against he say in the chapter. Your organisation needs engineers to create an impact on the mission. They have made the decision to run a tools inside kubernetes for the data team. It‚Äôs a no go for me too, all major cloud have dedicated tools for managing data related stuff. He just show his lack of knowledge here. And honestly if he needed ‚Äúmonth‚Äù to make it work he is not competent neither. Did users ask for this? Before reading anything, this is the typical question that make stop reading in general. Because of course no customer will tell you to use k8s, the ask for performance, security, stability not technology. He his the IT guys, he his in charge to find the solution not the customer. He acknowledge himself with his ‚ÄúGucci‚Äù metaphor, that at some point switching to k8s will make a real difference, did he say when ? no because he don‚Äôt know and have strong opinion to not do so. Do more with less. He say product have to be built with smaller teams that can deliver fast. I‚Äôts exactly on of the purpose of K8S, yeah if you have a 15GB container who takes 2min to startup K8S is not the good choice. But like all in IT, right tool, right moment, right place. He acknowledge that company should consider some of the higher-level building blocks available via cloud providers making my previous comment about data pipeline more laughable because he just demonstrate that instead of saying he made bad decision of choosing k8s for this purpose and not cloud providers tools, he reject the fault on the tools, ‚Äúsmashing nail with screwdriver is a premature optimization, dhoooooo‚Äù . His example with Whatsapp is moreover hilarious, they used erlang, so first, enginner in the past knowing erlang was only very good and experienced enginner and he probably don‚Äôt know what make erlang a so powerfull language for telecom, erlangVM, who, very naively in short, encapsulate every function in his own microVM, interraction between work with message send/receive, function can be update in place without any restart message will be smoothly reroute, erlangVM take care about mivroVM scalling. This is just the definition of kubernetes ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but at language lvl another topic is people needed to maintain, i‚Äôm the perfect example where a single guy can manage the cloud infra, k8s and slowly go out of backend dev and after 2-3 year alone starting to see some bottleneck and start to look for another person. Foot note: What is his recommendation ? no one Just a random guy who have not understand what he use and rant on the tools because of his ego 7:04 sorry big post :sweat_smile: This kind of people irritate me New 7:06 for the - you mentionned, it will be the same for every tools i would have used. even when we were in aws with elasticbean stalck i was the only one to touch it. I didn‚Äôt know it before hivency, i just was the only one who had the faith to read the doc :sweat_smile:</p>
                    <p>the real problem about that, and it‚Äôs part of my fault. It‚Äôs we didn‚Äôt explain, advocate, etc in depth why k8s, why now, etc. This and the 2 times service split start fail who will had add more sense. But for a recent exemple. I just was able to split Sidekiq worker in several server with just copy/pasting 5 files and change env variable injected to configure them. And now we can have a better vision of resource consumption and a better scalling for each type of queue. 7:12 it took me 1 hours to do so</p>
                    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>All tools, just like <a href="/2022/understanding-limits">physical laws</a>, have their range of application.</p>
