My favourite engineering metaphor is based on the ancient art of building bridges.
While there are [many types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridge_types),
the simplest one is the "plank of wood",
technically a [beam bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_bridge).

## ü§† The Cowboy and the Stream

Once upon a time, a cowboy wants to move some cattle across his property.

![Bridging a small stream is easy.](pics/building-bridges-small.png "1: simple drawing of a small river separating two bits of land, perhaps 3 meters long, with a cow for scale. 2: the river is now bridged by a plank of wood, with the cow walking on it. Source: the author.")

There is a small stream of water in the way (1).
Rather than have the cows wade it,
the cowboy sets a plank of wood across the water (2).
Cows go safely, everyone is happy.
The plank is a bit wobbly,
and perhaps it will not last very long,
but for being an old plank of wood that was lying around
it is definitely doing a good job.

## üìè The Over-engineered Bridge

The cowboy now finds a wider stream of water in their way.

![Bridging a medium stream can be hard.](pics/building-bridges-medium-12.png "1: a wider river, perhaps 5 meters wide, crossed by a long plank of wood. 2: the plank breaks and a cow drowns. Source: the author.")

He thinks to himself:
"This is easy, I will just build a longer plank of wood" (1).
But when his cows try to cross it,
the plank breaks near the middle due to the weight
and the cattle drown (2).

![A sophisticated solution and a simple solution.](pics/building-bridges-medium-34.png "3: a concrete arch bridge is now set over the water, with a cow safely crossing it. 4: a thicker plank over the water, with a cow trying to get on it. Source: the author.")

Desperate he asks his friend the engineer for a solution.
She comes up with a very simple yet clever arch bridge design (3):
just one piece of concrete that can be poured elsewhere and set in place.
When the cowboy hears the price, though,
he thinks to himself:
"I can do this! A thicker plank will do."
So with a lot of effort he builds a bigger, wider plank of wood (4).
The cows take some effort to walk onto it, but it works!

### ü§å First Moral

Was the arch bridge (3) over-engineered?
It depends;
the huge plank will probably do the job for some time,
but it will not last long and will definitely not resist a flooding.
Perhaps after having to rebuild it three or four times,
the cowboy will go with the engineer's design after all.
For a little bit more perspective, ask yourself:
the Romans built many bridges,
including [this one in Salamanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_bridge_of_Salamanca)
with 15 arches which is still standing 2000 years later.
The builders could have done a much simpler job to last only for a couple of centuries.
Were they over-engineering, or just awesome-engineering?

## üèóÔ∏è The Clumsy Bridge

But this was not all! The big challenge is here:
the cowboy realizes that if he could cross the river at its widest point,
almost 20 m across,
he would save 2 km on his way home!

![Bridging a large stream is really hard and needs specialized tools.](pics/building-bridges-large-12.png "1: a wider river, almost 20 meters wide, with a long thick plank of wood. 2: the plank again breaks and another cow drowns. Source: the author.")

Having learned his lesson he builds a thick plank like before (1),
but this time it is not enough:
it breaks and again his cattle drown (2).

![A simple solution and a complex solution. Try to see if you can tell which is which.](pics/building-bridges-large-34.png "3: a really thick plank of wood bridges the water, tapered on the extremes so that cows can climb on it. 4: a simple cable-stayed bridge now spans the water, with a few cables stabilizing the structure, and a cow crossing the water safely. Source: the author.")

He does not want to bother his friend the engineer,
plus he fears the price tag.
So he makes plans to build a really thick plank of wood (3).
He does not really know the amount of wood needed,
so to be sure he goes for a two-meter tall "plank".
There are no tree trunks this tall,
so a more complex structure with many layers is required.
This takes forever and he is not really happy with the result.
Also it is now taller than a cow,
so the cattle need a cumbersome tapered structure at the ends
to be able to climb it.
Meanwhile costs skyrocket due to the insane amounts of wood and labor required.

The engineer comes by and suggests a simple cable-stayed bridge (4),
which would not be a huge investment compared to all the materials already used:
poured concrete and steel cables.
The cowboy, having invested so much effort and time,
tells her that he will go on with his project.

After a couple of months he comes again to the engineer,
utterly defeated while simulating casualness,
and asks for the engineer's help.
It is completed in three weeks,
under budget since she is very cost-conscious,
and it is not really very challenging.

### ü§å Second Moral

This contrived example tries to illustrate the reality of evolving software:
the techniques that were once appropriate may become a real drag as the system grows.

At what point should we stop using wooden planks and start using concrete bridges?
It is hard to foresee the future,
but easy to judge in retrospect.
Good engineers will refine their criteria over time,
while cowboys will always be cowboys.

## ü§î Conclusion

All tools, just like [physical laws](/2022/understanding-limits),
have their range of application.
The good engineer needs to know and dominate a wide range of techniques,
and be able to switch between them depending on the needs of the project.
