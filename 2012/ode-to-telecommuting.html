                    <p>At MoveinBlue we love telecommuting. And it is
                    not just that we don‚Äôt like offices: we have an
                    office, and <a
                    href="https://moveinblue.com/things-to-do/madrid/we-get-you-a-coffee">we
                    invite you to a coffee</a> if you want to come visit
                    us. But coffee brewed at home is much better than
                    office coffee.</p>
                    <h2 id="the-pros">The Pros</h2>
                    <p>Basically, you get your life back. No longer do
                    you have to spend an hour or more going to and from
                    the office; no more run to unproductive meetings all
                    day long.</p>
                    <p>Flexible hours is good; <em>truly flexible
                    hours</em> is the best invention since fire. Are you
                    more productive at night, so you prefer to wake up
                    at 12:00? Your choice. Do you want to take the kids
                    to school and to the park, but will work nicely
                    while they are at school and at night? Perfect!</p>
                    <p>Working at MoveinBlue (and in most tech jobs)
                    only requires a computer and a comfy chair; most
                    people can have that at home (and probably already
                    have). Other lines of work may require more personal
                    contact, but ours is just perfect. Oh, and the
                    company doesn‚Äôt have to provide computer and office
                    space too, so everyone wins.</p>
                    <p>Meetings are harder to do when some people are
                    off-site, but there is a lesson in there too: do not
                    meet with people unless it is really necessary.
                    Often a phone call will do; and most of the time
                    email is good enough.</p>
                    <h2 id="the-cons">The Cons</h2>
                    <p>One of the most serious drawbacks of
                    telecommuting is that it requires a special kind of
                    discipline. Not just <a
                    href="developer-discipline">developer
                    discipline</a>, but the kind that you need to do
                    your domestic chores or any unpleasant tasks.
                    Specially if you come from a corporate setting where
                    bosses used to mark your stride for you. Oh, and
                    loving your work helps a lot.</p>
                    <p>The day with complete freedom ahead of you can be
                    very long; you have to be centered in your tasks to
                    get anything done. Be careful not to spend a whole
                    day watching episodes of your favorite TV show, for
                    example. Work time must be taken seriously even if
                    you are not in an office.</p>
                    <p>Your family and friends also need to learn to
                    respect work hours. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working‚Äù can be used as a
                    formula just as magical as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the office‚Äù.
                    Drawing clear lines around your work can lead to
                    some tensions with the family, but the situation
                    will tend to be much better than commuting to work,
                    so they will probably understand.</p>
                    <p>Some workers need extensive mentoring for their
                    jobs, and it is hard to do that remotely. In those
                    cases a week or even a day on-site can do
                    wonders.</p>
                    <p>How do you deal with the complete disconnect from
                    office life? If you are anything like me, mostly
                    with relief. There may be a problem getting to know
                    what to do, but this point can also turn to our
                    advantage: having a written spec now cannot be
                    avoided. For those unavoidable rounds of improvement
                    then it is better to have direct contact between the
                    person specifying the requirements and the one doing
                    the work. In these cases just connect the two for a
                    face-to-face session.</p>
                    <h2 id="can-it-be-done">Can It Be Done?</h2>
                    <p>Sure! If Stephen Wolfram has been a <a
                    href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/">remote
                    CEO</a> for 20 years, then we can be remote
                    developers too! <a
                    href="http://gigaom.com/collaboration/tales-from-the-trenches-github/">40%
                    of github‚Äôs workforce is remote</a>. <a
                    href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3064-stop-whining-and-start-hiring-remote-workers">37
                    signals</a> does not provide exact numbers but
                    apparently most of its workers are remote.</p>
                    <p>Evaluating remote employees is not very different
                    than on-site reviews: just review their work and see
                    if it progresses. It can even be more objective: it
                    is harder to suck up remotely. Technical merits tend
                    to shine better from afar.</p>
                    <p>So just lose your fear and start working
                    remotely! Oh and by the way, we are always <a
