<p>The project is over: designs have been verified, the code has been
deployed and everything is published. Now what? Well, of course: we
iterate.</p>
<h2 id="why-keep-at-it">Why Keep At It?</h2>
<p>When a project is first completed people just want to leave
everything and go on holidays. Things are working, more or less, and the
promised functionality is here. But very few applications are really
successful as they were initially designed. In fact, very few
applications are even useful as initially designed.</p>
<p>The reason is our inability as designers to imagine how the real flow
of an application is going to work out in practice. The best designs
come out of a static application, or at best a mock up thrown together
in some wireframe tool. Once things work it is time to optimize: this
button is hard to find, this other widget would be more useful on this
other place, and so on. And it is not only the external interface: new
functionalities will probably come handy to complement the existing
ones.</p>
<h2 id="conversion">Conversion</h2>
<p>Let us take a look at web applications targeted at the general
public, where there is a more objective reason: conversion. How many of
your users are actually buying anything? How many do register? How many
do even get to the second screen? A single conversion is one of your
users that becomes a customer. But what if there are hundreds of new
users and only a few conversions?</p>
<p>It makes more sense to talk about percentages: if traffic suddenly
increases it is reasonable to expect a proportional increase in
conversions. So conversion can be measured as the proportion of users
that become customers, usually expressed as a percentage. If only ten
users reach your site on a given day and two buy something then you have
an astounding 20% conversion; but if those two come from a thousand
visitors then the conversion is a lousy 0.2%. Conversions to paying
customers are usually a few percentage points, say: 1~3%. Anything lower
and you have to seriously rethink your strategy or your product;
anything higher and you have a serious hit in your hands.</p>
<p>But it is not reasonable to just measure the desired outcome and
expect it to grow: each one of the steps required to become a customer
should be measured carefully to find out how many of your users make it
‚Äì and inversely how many are lost in the way. The numbers may scare you.
The result is usually presented as a funnel: at each step of the funnel
a higher percentage fall out, and at the bottom lie conversions. Leads
are an intermediate step: they represent potential customers, and they
are an important milestone. Simply put, someone that clicks through an
offer is a lead.</p>
<h2 id="iterative-improvement">Iterative Improvement</h2>
<p>Each iteration should be guided by a metric to be improved, and
conversion is the perfect fit: if we are doing things right it should
improve steadily with every cycle.</p>
<p>Sometimes progress is not so steady: if you keep adding and removing
a feature, for example, then you are stuck in a circle. It is important
to be on the lookup for these situations and prevent them as fast as
possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes asking for quantitative improvement can introduce a certain
degree of delay into the process: should you start improving your system
before you are measuring? The answer is: yes, of course! Just be sure to
be able to collect metrics before the changes are deployed.</p>
<p>The speed of progress depends on just two factors: the duration of
the cycles and the span covered in each iteration. Cycles of one week
will probably take you there faster than if they take one month,
something which sometimes cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of pure software engineering: how to
create requirements, build a design, develop the code and test it in
just one week? Or in one month? There are many agile methodologies to
choose from; just keep in mind that the goal is not to follow a
methodology but to improve on a software system.</p>
<h2 id="peeling-the-onion">Peeling The Onion</h2>
<p>How can conversion be improved? Easy: just asking users. But this
apparently trivial task can be quite hard to accomplish; people pay
specialized firms lots of money to find out what their users want. Focus
groups, recorded usability tests, and remote testing are all expensive.
Online questionnaires have a negligible response and can actually harm
your conversion; not to speak about feedback tabs.</p>
<p>But it can be done. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing">Usability
testing</a> can be as easy as asking a few people to use your
application and later requesting their opinion. Do not be afraid to ask
your coworkers, friends, family and even passers-by. The most visible
mistakes and omissions will usually be easy to spot and will require
just superficial questioning, while more elaborate problems will be
harder to elicit. You have to make sure that testers are motivated; a
small prize in return for the effort is usually enough. Also, be sure to
receive the feedback in a neutral fashion, or everyone will feel
compelled to sugarcoat their responses.</p>
<p>If you want to follow some method there is <a
href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html">hallway testing</a>,
one of Spolsky‚Äôs <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">12
steps to better code</a>. It is not hard to do: take five random people,
give them tasks to do with your application and stay behind them to see
what problems they encounter, or what they expect to find and don‚Äôt.
Take notes of everything, and do not help unless asked. When they have
finished, ask people about their experience. Finally digest their
suggestions with the development team.</p>
<p>At each iteration some obstacles will be removed, peeling one more
layer back. Then new obstacles will appear which were hidden by that
layer. Potential users may tell you what problems they had to accomplish
their tasks. Even more important is to find out about missing features,
but users may find them hard to pinpoint their unfulfilled needs:
finding out a solution to a necessity may require a lot of imagination
and sometimes creativity. Users will be able to spot these unfulfilled
necessities, and that is what you need to listen. Then be sure to
provide it!</p>
<h2 id="when-to-stop">When to Stop</h2>
<p>Not everything can be improved forever: after a number of iterations
our efforts will be wasted. How many layers does the onion have? The
answer may well be: infinite, there are always details to improve. So
let us rephrase the question: how do we know that we have reached the
point of diminishing returns?</p>
<p>A lead rate of 17% should be our most immediate objective. That is
the percentage of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_Innovations">innovators
and early adopters combined</a>, and they are very likely to use your
applications. But you have to reach the early majority before your
application has a significant appeal. Of course not everyone will be
converted to a customer; they might not have the money. But at least
they should enter your store and browse around.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will not be iterating your designs eternally, but as a
practical matter you should always keep improving your website. Even if
the conversion rate is good and customers are satisfied: Amazon has not
stopped improving their website, and few online shops think that they
have already enough customers. The same is valid for any other web
applications out there: keep improving, even if you are not iterating
every week.</p>
