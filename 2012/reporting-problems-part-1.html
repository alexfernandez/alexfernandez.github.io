<p>Software has bugs; this is a widely known secret about software
development. How do we deal with this? The first step is to open
communication channels between users and developers. In this first part
I will look into how problems should be reported; in a second part I
will discuss the principles for a good problem reporting tool.</p>
<h2 id="managing-bugs">Managing Bugs</h2>
<p>A malfunction in a software system is found; what we usually call a
bug. The developers should know about it and probably correct it; what
do we do with it? Our first idea is to report it to the team in person,
but they may reply: “Not so fast! There are procedures for that.” Why <a
href="http://dilbert.com/fast/2008-01-17/">so much arrogance</a>?
Simple: in a medium-to-large project there are probably tens or hundreds
of malfunctions, people tend to report the same issue multiple times,
and the development team has to manage all that information. Not all
bugs can be corrected immediately: some are more important than others,
and some can even be postponed as they cause only minor visual
problems.</p>
<p>That is why <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html">bug
trackers</a> were invented: they allowed developers to keep track of
every individual malfunction, including: who reported it, what developer
is responsible for it and in what state it is at the moment. They are
the perfect tool for a group of specialized testers and the development
team to communicate; and they help management evaluate the
situation.</p>
<p>Mozilla developers, knowing the problem of releasing software to the
public, created a tool called <a
href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>. Proprietary software
developers had long had ticketing systems, change request managers and
other tracking tools, but this was the first major bug tracking system
released as Free software.</p>
<p>But before we even reach the state of bug tracking, there is an issue
to solve: what is a bug? To the software developer a “bug” is a mistake
introduced in the code of a software system. There are other terms in
use: error, defect, crash. But we are not going to fight about words,
are we?</p>
<h2 id="issues-problems-and-bugs">Issues, Problems and Bugs</h2>
<p>It is not easy to make bug reporters communicate with people
responsible of fixing bugs. First there is a language barrier: one is
supposedly a domain expert (meaning that they know what to do with the
software), while the other is a software developer, and they do not
necessarily share a common language to describe problems. What looks
like wrong output to one might be a problem with the requirements to the
other; what one identifies as a plain bug, the other may discard as
simply a misconfiguration.</p>
<p>A common obstacle when reporting problems in software is
miscommunication between the reporter and the software developer. The
obstacle often arises because non-technical people know our little
secret: that software has bugs. So they tend to attribute all of their
problems in life to software bugs, when to the developer they may be
caused by many other things.</p>
<p>Note that a bug is only considered as such if the software doesn’t do
what it is supposed to do; but different people may have different ideas
about it. Communication is not always perfect; any mistake in the
specification (if someone took the trouble to write it down) will look
like a software bug to the user, but will just be a wrong requirement to
the developer. At other times features are not even implemented, so they
won’t work; but the engineer will refuse to acknowledge a bug in code
that hasn’t been written.</p>
<p>But you know what? The customer is always right, and the user is our
customer. If any user takes the trouble to report a problem, then there
probably is a problem, at least for that particular user. It might be
ignorance by the user on how the software works; an error in the
specification, or a missing feature; misconfiguration of the system or
requirements not met; or perhaps a good old software bug. But whatever
the cause, any reported problem should be taken seriously and solved if
possible.</p>
<h2 id="solving-problems">Solving Problems</h2>
<p>How to solve the problem depends a lot of what the problem is,
obviously. But we can outline a process to manage the report: to process
it until it is solved.</p>
<p>First, someone needs to take responsibility for the report; we will
call this figure the “report manager”, although it doesn’t need to be a
figure of authority. The problem may be diverted to user support to be
identified, and hopefully solved by teaching the reporter how to use the
software. Otherwise the report passes to the next stage.</p>
<p>As we have seen the problem may be caused by many different things:
requirements, configuration, user documentation, etcetera. The manager
must decide if the problem can be solved by systems admins, requirements
engineers or any other team, and refer the report to them. All the
possibilities must be discarded first; some companies have elaborate
escalation procedures, others just let the report manager decide.
Several layers of support are common once an organization grows above a
certain level. Whatever workflow is most appropriate in your situation
is fine; just be sure to think about it and improve it if needed.</p>
<p>Finally, if nobody else has found the cause the development team has
to take care of the report. If the problem really is caused by a
development product (a software bug, or an error in the manuals perhaps)
then it should eventually be assigned to someone who can solve it.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-problems">Types of Problems</h2>
<p>When we have more than a handful of reports we will probably want to
divide them in groups. One obvious way is to identify and remove
duplicates. Apart from leaving just one report for each problem, the
most significant categories all refer to the underlying problem.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that “problems” should refer to repeatable conditions,
not one-time faults. Specifying that “I could not access the system from
2:00 to 4:00 last night” is no good, since there is no way to reproduce
the problem and find the root cause.</p>
<p>So, how can we categorize reported problems? The most productive
types divide problems into groups according to their origin as we saw
above: software bug, documentation issue, configuration error, and so
on. Within software bugs it can be useful to distinguish between a
malfunction and a visual problem, for instance if you are dealing with a
web application where the HTML layout can be botched up but be
completely functional.</p>
<p>There are a couple of special types often thrown into the mix: a
“missing feature” is something which has not been implemented and
should, while “wish list” identifies a desirable feature which has not
been planned yet for inclusion.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to categorize bugs: severity, priority,
number of users affected, subsystem where the problem arises, etcetera.
Users should be able to enter those values that make sense to them; the
rest should be entered by the report manager. As we saw before users may
be challenged to find the correct category for a problem, e.g. mistaking
missing features as bugs; the report manager should review the problem
type assigned by users, if any.</p>
<h2 id="more-on-problem-reporting">More on Problem Reporting</h2>
<p>There is a lot of literature on bug management, but problem reporting
has not received the attention it deserves as a separate task; let us
hope that this post serves to make the issue more prominent. Use the
comments section for any aspects I may have left behind.</p>
<p>In the <a href="reporting-problems-part-2">second part</a> we will
discuss the elements of a good problem reporting tool; be sure to tune
in!</p>
