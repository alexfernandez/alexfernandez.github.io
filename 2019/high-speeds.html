<p>Really high speeds are out of our ordinary experience, and can be quite hard to apprehend. Is a rocket to the moon closer to a person walking or to the unmovable wall of the speed of light? In this article we will see a graded approach to appreciate how fast they really are, and at which point in our history they were achieved.</p>
<h2 id="by-intervals">By Intervals</h2>
<p>A grading scale will make it easier to categorize high speeds.</p>
<h3 id="ms">1 m/s</h3>
<p>We start at a comfortable pace of 1 meter per second, which is 3.6 km/h or 2.2 miles per hour (mph). We are definitely out of the realm of hyperspeeds for now.</p>
<p>This relatively slow pace is easy to achieve by a walking person, and indeed for animals of all kinds. It is however not so easy for bacteria and other unicellular animals to reach 1 m/s on their own; a protozoo in the wind is out of scope for our purposes. We may assume that the first moving organisms to move this fast lived in the sea, perhaps the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish">jellyfish</a>. For instance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish">box jellyfish</a> can move at up to 2 m/s.</p>
<h3 id="ms-1">10 m/s</h3>
<p>We are now at 36 km/h or 22 mph, still below hypervelocities. It is logically hard to know when animals first breached that speed; perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladoselache">the first sharks</a>.</p>
<p>As to humans, we are around our top running speed: Bolt can run 100 m in less than 10 seconds, with <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/resources/records/speed.htm">peak speeds of 12.42 m/s</a>. But our ancestors have been great runners for a long time, and surely they have run downhill attaining high speeds.</p>
<h3 id="ms-2">100 m/s</h3>
<p>At 360 km/h and 223 mph, we have reached at a very interesting point in our scale. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_animals">No known animals</a> are able to reach this speed except for the peregrine falcon, which <a href="https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/falling-with-the-falcon-7491768/">has been clocked at 389 km/h</a>: it essentially flies up and then dives at terminal velocity.</p>
<p>With humans the issue is similarly contended. A modern compound bow can reach 347 feet per second (105 m/s), and crossbows can be <a href="https://pickabow.com/fastest-crossbow/">even faster at 460 fps</a>. But it is doubtful that ancient weapons could reach these speeds. So throwing something at above 100 m/s is probably a modern achievement that had to wait for firearms, like the arquebus in the 14th century which could shoot at <a href="http://www.rapidoyfacil.es/wiki/otras_reglas_para_ryf/equipo/armas_de_fuego_antiguas">300 m/s</a>.</p>
<p>But enough with projectiles: when was the first time that a human reached this speed? Barring people falls from balloons or other accidents it was probably an aircraft; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_records">Wikipedia’s page of aircraft records</a> lists the date as 1922, on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss_CR">Curtiss CR</a> piloted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mitchell">the father of the USAF</a>. Interestingly, there are now a variety of vehicles that can reach that speed, from cars to trains.</p>
<h4 id="ms-3">1000 m/s</h4>
<p>At 1 km/s, 3600 km/h or 2237 mph, we have now amply surpassed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound">speed of sound</a>.</p>
<p>Many categories of weapons can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_velocity#Categories_of_velocity">reach these speeds</a>. The first might have been the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.220_Swift">.220 Swift</a> at 1200 m/s.</p>
<h5 id="kms">10 km/s</h5>
<p>We are now in the realm of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervelocity">hypervelocities</a>. Incidentally, we are really close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity">escape velocity from Earth</a>.</p>
<h4 id="kms-1">100 km/s</h4>
<p>We have now officially surpassed the escape velocity of the biggest planet in the solar system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, which is just 60 km/s.</p>
<p>Particles at dust accelerators can <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016/pdf/1653.pdf">exceed this speed</a>. But the first human-made object to reach it was probably a humble manhole cover.</p>
<h4 id="kms-2">1000 km/s</h4>
<p>At this point we can escape even from the sun cleanly, which only requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#List_of_escape_velocities">617 km/s</a>.</p>
<p>At this tremendous speed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy">Little Boy</a>, the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, would cause 35 times more destruction from kinetic energy (2.2e15 J) than when it was detonated (15 kilotons or 6.3e13 J).</p>
<h4 id="kms-3">10,000 km/s</h4>
<p>Is there no end to this madness? In fact, at 10 thousand km per second we are still far from the Universe’s top speed of 300 thousand km/s.</p>
<h4 id="kms-4">100,000 km/s</h4>
<h4 id="kms-5">1,000,000 km/s</h4>
<p>We have now officially surpassed the fastest speed possible.</p>
