Really high speeds are out of our ordinary experience,
and can be quite hard to apprehend.
Is a rocket to the moon closer to a person walking or to the unmovable wall of the speed of light?
In this article we will see a graded approach to appreciate how fast they really are,
and at which point in our history they were achieved.

## By Intervals

A grading scale will make it easier to categorize high speeds.

### 1 m/s

We start at a comfortable pace of 1 meter per second,
which is 3.6 km/h or 2.2 miles per hour (mph).
We are definitely out of the realm of hyperspeeds for now.

This relatively slow pace is easy to achieve by a walking person,
and indeed for animals of all kinds.
It is however not so easy for bacteria and other unicellular animals
to reach 1 m/s on their own;
a protozoo in the wind is out of scope for our purposes.
We may assume that the first moving organisms to move this fast lived in the sea,
perhaps the first [jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish).
For instance the [box jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish)
can move at up to 2 m/s.

### 10 m/s

We are now at 36 km/h or 22 mph,
still below hypervelocities.
It is logically hard to know when animals first breached that speed;
perhaps [the first sharks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladoselache).

As to humans,
we are around our top running speed:
Bolt can run 100 m in less than 10 seconds,
with [peak speeds of 12.42 m/s](https://www.topendsports.com/resources/records/speed.htm).
But our ancestors have been great runners for a long time,
and surely they have run downhill attaining high speeds.

### 100 m/s

At 360 km/h and 223 mph,
we have reached at a very interesting point in our scale.
[No known animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_animals) are able to reach this speed
except for the peregrine falcon,
which [has been clocked at 389 km/h](https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/falling-with-the-falcon-7491768/):
it essentially flies up and then dives at terminal velocity.

With humans the issue is similarly contended.
A modern compound bow can reach 347 feet per second (105 m/s),
and crossbows can be [even faster at 460 fps](https://pickabow.com/fastest-crossbow/).
But it is doubtful that ancient weapons could reach these speeds.
So throwing something at above 100 m/s is probably a modern achievement
that had to wait for firearms,
like the arquebus in the 14th century which could shoot at
[300 m/s](http://www.rapidoyfacil.es/wiki/otras_reglas_para_ryf/equipo/armas_de_fuego_antiguas).

But enough with projectiles: when was the first time that a human reached this speed?
Barring people falls from balloons or other accidents it was probably an aircraft;
[Wikipedia's page of aircraft records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_records)
lists the date as 1922, on a [Curtiss CR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss_CR)
piloted by [the father of the USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mitchell).
Interestingly, there are now a variety of vehicles that can reach that speed,
from cars to trains.

#### 1000 m/s

At 1 km/s, 3600 km/h or 2237 mph,
we have now amply surpassed the [speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound).

Many categories of weapons can
[reach these speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_velocity#Categories_of_velocity).
The first might have been
the [.220 Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.220_Swift) at 1200 m/s.

##### 10 km/s

We are now in the realm of
[hypervelocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervelocity).
Incidentally, we are really close to the
[escape velocity from Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity).

#### 100 km/s

We have now officially surpassed the escape velocity of the biggest planet in the solar system,
[Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter), which is just 60 km/s.

Particles at dust accelerators can [exceed this speed](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016/pdf/1653.pdf).
But the first human-made object to reach it was probably a humble manhole cover.

#### 1000 km/s

At this point we can escape even from the sun cleanly,
which only requires [617 km/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity#List_of_escape_velocities).

At this tremendous speed [Little Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy),
the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima,
would cause 35 times more destruction from kinetic energy (2.2e15 J)
than when it was detonated (15 kilotons or 6.3e13 J).

#### 10,000 km/s

Is there no end to this madness?
In fact, at 10 thousand km per second we are still far from the Universe's top speed of 300 thousand km/s.

#### 100,000 km/s

#### 1,000,000 km/s

We have now officially surpassed the fastest speed possible.
