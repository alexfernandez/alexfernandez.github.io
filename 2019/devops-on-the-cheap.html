<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Before adopting any existing tool always consider building a custom
tool. It may be a better fit for your particular needs; you will learn a
lot and have fun too!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-continuous-deployment">What Is Continuous
Deployment</h2>
<p>For many years I have advocated for continuous deployment (CD), in
fact since I learned about the technique in 2011 on the wonderful <a
href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920000136.do">Web
Operations</a> by Allspaw &amp; Robins.</p>
<p>Essentially it means deploying each change the moment it is ready,
instead of waiting until many changes are piled up and tested. Tests run
automatically and verify that the code is fit for production.</p>
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>For me CD is the most relevant practice in the hot pot known as
‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù. CD encompasses many important disciplines: testing,
integration and deployment, with a layer of automation to make it as
agile as possible.</p>
<p>Practitioners that have tried this practice have found that the
number of errors is reduced as the number of daily deployments
increases. The clueless manager would contend that increasing the number
of deployments will increase exponentially the number of errors in
production, but this is not the case. One reason is that changes are
deployed individually, which reduces the possibility of compound errors.
Also automatic test suites become quite important and they are cared for
on a daily basis, which creates a virtuous cycle of improvement and
stability.</p>
<p>When an error does actually appear in production it is usually easy
to confine to the latest deployment, instead of having to browse endless
lists of changes to find out what went wrong. Small changes are trivial
to roll back: just go back to the previous commit.</p>
<h3 id="its-lesser-relatives">Its Lesser Relatives</h3>
<p>It is unfortunate that the acronym CD has been co-opted by a much
less powerful version. With continuous delivery changes are tested but
not deployed until there is a manual intervention step. In essence we
are back to piling up changes, which makes our job much harder.</p>
<p>Continuous delivery is well suited for environments where a manual
step is hard to avoid, such as regulatory audits or manual frontend
tests. In my experience it is usually worth the effort to try to
automate even these hard situations, but it is indeed harder to do.</p>
<p>There is also continuous integration (CI), where code is tested after
each commit and possibly deployed to an integration server.</p>
<h2 id="the-adventure">The Adventure</h2>
<p>In March 2019 I joined <a
href="https://influencity.com/">Influencity</a>, an influencer marketing
company, as CTO. I had the chance to set technology priorities, and of
course my first priority was to set up continuous deployment.</p>
<h3 id="preconditions">Preconditions</h3>
<p>When a system has been built without regard for technical concerns it
is not trivial to set up continuous deployment and we should proceed
incrementally. First we should strive for continuous integration.</p>
<p>The right approach to automation is usually to start with a
well-understood manual task, and then automate every bit. Afterwards you
can keep on improving until your automatic process is better than the
manual task ever was.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: how easy is it to do integration of changes manually?
At first it will probably involve a lot of manual work, so we should
always start with automation of these manual steps until integration can
be done with the push of a button.</p>
<p>It does not really need to be a literal button: running a script
should be enough. As long as you don‚Äôt need to remember a lot of arcane
options or manual steps; integration needs to be started with one simple
step. Our first task was therefore to streamline and clean up the
integration environment.</p>
<p>Another precondition is to have a solid test suite. Without it your
integrations will probably be quite brittle and hard to fix, since you
will lose track of which specific commit broke a given functionality.
Errors should surface as fast as possible, and your test suite is your
best friend.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt really need to test everything: unit tests at this point
will probably yield little benefit, while integration tests are a much
more solid investment. Given that the backend was essentially a GraphQL
API, we only needed to test that the controllers were working properly.
For every entity that we had in the system a good test should check that
it can be created, edited, queried and deleted properly. E.g. for
users:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new user,</li>
<li>query the user,</li>
<li>edit user data,</li>
<li>and finally delete the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>This basic structure gives us the skeleton for every integration
test, and it can usually be adapted for most situations. Resulting tests
are also nicely idempotent: they can be run as often as needed without
polluting the database.</p>
<p>In a few weeks my team created a robust automated test suite for the
backend, and also set up a nice culture of writing tests along with
every new development.</p>
<h3 id="package-selection">Package Selection</h3>
<p>Now it was time to choose a tool for continuous deployment. There are
a few well established services to do it like <a
href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a>. or <a
href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>. As for on-premise <a
href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> is the best known tool, along
with its more modern cousin <a href="https://jenkins-x.io/">Jenkins
X</a>. There are also other smaller contenders such as <a
href="https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider">Strider CD</a>, which I
have <a href="../2016/stridercd">used in the past</a>. So it should be
an easy decision to just evaluate the most promising options and either
hire or install the best one.</p>
<p>I did just that and came back a bit disappointed. None of the
services or products were really a good fit for us:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Travis-CI needs access to your repos and your infrastructure,
which is a further point of failure. It can be set up with webhooks.
Also the price for companies is not exactly cheap, at <a
href="https://travis-ci.com/plans">$63/month</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>CircleCI is cheaper at <a
href="https://circleci.com/pricing/">$0/month</a> for one concurrent
build, which is a great option. There is again the issue of giving
access to repos and infrastructure. Also it seems to require some kind
of Docker image (or other VMs), and it is not trivial to configure if
your infrastructure is not geared towards Docker.</p></li>
<li><p>Jenkins is a monster. With <a
href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/">more than 1500 plugins</a> I am sure
that it covers all necessities that anyone may have, but it is a bit
overwhelming. I have used it at my previous job, Devo, and configuration
was a mess. If at all possible I would like to avoid it for the rest of
my professional career.</p></li>
<li><p>Jenkins X is an unknown, and also seems to require Docker. Not
that I have anything against Docker as a technology, but at Influencity
it would have meant another roadblock towards adoption of CD. That is
exactly what I wanted to avoid.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I have a lot of love for Strider. First it has ‚ÄúCD‚Äù in
the title instead of the more common ‚ÄúCI‚Äù. I have used it for a couple
of projects during the last few years and it worked great! At mediasmart
we even contributed a little bit to it. But development seemed spotty:
<a
href="https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider/commits/master">commits</a>
are erratic, and at that point there had been few in the last
months.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-custom-option">The Custom Option</h3>
<p>I thought to myself that the task could not be that hard. In essence
what I wanted was simple enough: something that run a build each time a
commit was pushed. More bells and whistles could be added later.</p>
<p>I have used Node.js for DevOps work for many years now, and even
spoken about it in public: <a
href="/2017/build-your-own-devops-infrastructure">Build Your Own DevOps
Infrastructure</a>. I have to say I have always been quite happy with
it: it runs reliably, code can be written very quickly and there are
libraries for everything.</p>
<p>So with the help of my colleagues at Influencity we started building
a prototype.</p>
<h2 id="development-phases">Development Phases</h2>
<p>The following work was mostly done in my spare time in a couple of
months, with invaluable help and advice from the rest of the team. I
will use the present tense to make it closer to the reader.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-automated-integration">Phase 1: Automated
Integration</h3>
<p>In the first phase we create an HTTP server (a ‚Äúweb app‚Äù in standard
terminology), running in a directory and listening on a given port on
the integration server. It can be accessed simply by pointing a web
browser at</p>
<pre><code>http://[control-server]:[port]/build</code></pre>
<p>When this URL is accessed it should download the current branch of a
repo, run a build and restart the server; and show all the output from
these commands. When the process finishes it should print an error
message if anything was broken. The web app can also be run locally to
debug any possible issues.</p>
<p>Internally it is a very simplistic HTTP server using the <a
href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html">HTTP system library</a>; nothing
fancy like restify or fastify is really needed. It invokes a single
command similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>cd [repo-name] &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; pm2 reload all</code></pre>
<p>where <code>[repo-name]</code> is the name of the repo and
<code>pm2</code> is used to restart the service.</p>
<p>The only ‚Äúclever‚Äù bit is a library to run a command and redirect its
output to a stream, so that it can be shown on the build page as it is
happening.</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-attach-webhook">Phase 2: Attach Webhook</h3>
<p>When the web app is up and running it is easy to connect it to GitHub
using a <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">webhook</a>.
Every time there is a push to the repo GitHub will send us an event,
informing us of the branch that has been pushed <a
href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent">among
other things</a>. Let us see a real-life example from the <a
href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest/">loadtest repo</a>,
showing only the most relevant info received in a push event:</p>

<span id="cb3-14"><a href="#cb3-14" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can read the branch from the <code>ref</code>, which is either
<code>refs/heads/[branch]</code> or <code>refs/tags/[tag]</code>; we are
only interested in ‚Äúheads‚Äù at the moment. Then we can read the latest
commit from <code>after</code> if we want to download just that. The
repository object contains name, URL and a lot of additional info.
Finally we have the <code>pusher</code> with an email of the person
doing the push, which we can use to send an email notification with
either success or failure.</p>
<p>At this point we only want to read the branch to check if it‚Äôs equal
to the current branch (usually <code>master</code>), which we can read
using the command:</p>
<pre><code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise we will stop and do nothing. So the web app now needs to
read and understand push events from GitHub. At this point we need to
read the request sent by the server, and we might be tempted to use some
web framework like Fastify. But thanks to the magic of promises it takes
around 8 lines of code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="fu">readBody</span>(request) {</span>

<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    request<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">on</span>(<span class="st">&#39;end&#39;</span><span class="op">,</span> () <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="fu">resolve</span>(<span class="bu">Buffer</span><span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">concat</span>(buffers)))</span>

<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  })</span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then a couple to parse the result:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">const</span> body <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cf">await</span> <span class="fu">readBody</span>(request)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">const</span> json <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">JSON</span><span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">parse</span>(body)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another modification is necessary: GitHub expects the webhook to
return as soon as possible or it will time out. Therefore instead of
showing all command output on the web page we need a new endpoint to
just return HTTP code 200 ‚ÄúOK‚Äù and finish. Since we are not displaying
the result we need to know how it went: we add email notifications using
Amazon Simple Email Service (AWS SES). Command output is now stored in a
buffer and sent in the email body.</p>
<p>To recapitulate: with every push to <code>master</code> the code
would be built and tested. download the given branch on the server, run
build and restart the service, and send an email with the results. This
will allow the dev team to learn that the latest push needs fixing as
soon as possible. The old endpoint that shows the output as a web page
is still maintained for debugging purposes.</p>
<h3 id="phase-3-multi-repo">Phase 3: Multi Repo</h3>
<p>Our little prototype was listening just for a single repo. In this
new phase we would like to expand it for multiple repos. As we saw
before we can read the repo and branch from the GitHub push event
info.</p>
<p>We will need a new control server where we can run reliable builds
without contaminating our integration server. The idea now is to run a
build for <strong>every branch</strong> that is pushed to Github. We
start with a copy of the integration server and create a structure of
directories where we will download each branch:</p>
<pre><code>repos/[branch]/[repo]</code></pre>
<p>We will place the branch first so the repo is downloaded into a
directory with its own name, something which npm tends to like
better.</p>
<p>Now we can add a testing step to the build: * for the backend we
already have a test suite which we can partially trust, * in some other
repos we just want to check syntax with <code>eslint .</code>, * for a
library without tests it may be relevant to just run
<code>node index.js</code> to see that nothing explodes, * and if there
is no testing at all we can just <code>echo "THIS IS FINE"</code>.</p>
<p>Any of these can be mapped to the standard npm command
<code>npm test</code>. Now our build consists of the command</p>
<pre><code>cd repos/[branch]/[repo] &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm test</code></pre>
<p>With this additional step we now have a measure of quality
validation. For some repos we may want to deploy to the integration
server after a success. Again we can use a simple SSH command:</p>
<pre><code>ssh [integration-server] &quot;cd [repo] &amp;&amp; git pull &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; pm2 reload all&quot;</code></pre>
<p>For other repos we want to use a different command, or even skip this
deployment step at all. So we add a deployment command if the branch is
<code>master</code>, configurable by repository.</p>
<p><em>Et voil√†!</em> Continuous integration on the cheap.</p>
<h3 id="phase-4-let-the-world-know">Phase 4: Let the World Know</h3>
<p>This was cool. At this point our little deployment script was close
to 200 lines. For the next phase we want to learn about builds using
something different than email, which gets tiresome after a few dozen
pushes.</p>
<p>First we want to send the result of the build to AWS CloudWatch. This
way we can set alarms when a build for to a particular branch (usually
<code>master</code>) and repo (e.g.¬†backend) is broken. We can also
compute metrics for our builds.</p>
<p>The package <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/">aws-sdk</a> makes it
quite easy to integrate with CloudWatch: it just takes a single call to
<a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/CloudWatch.html#putMetricData-property"><code>putMetricData</code></a>,
using the branchd and repo as ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù with a custom metric.</p>
<p>We now get to one of the life-changing moments of the project. Look
at these super-cool icons besides each commit:</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/devops-github-pr.png" title="GitHub builds"
alt="GitHub builds for loadtest generated by Travis-CI." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">GitHub builds for loadtest generated by
Travis-CI.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For each commit Travis is informed and it runs the automated test
suite, letting us know if the build worked (‚úÖ) or failed (‚ùå).</p>
<p>Can we do that with our multi-deployment script? Of course! We just
need to connect our server with GitHub in the opposite direction, using
the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>.</p>
<p>With Node.js it is in fact quite easy thanks to the official npm
package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/rest"><span
class="citation" data-cites="octokit/rest">@octokit/rest</span></a>.
Essentially you just need to <a
href="https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/#octokit-routes-repos-create-status">create
a status</a>: first the status is set as <code>pending</code>, then when
finished you set it to either <code>failure</code> or
<code>success</code>.</p>
<p>You can also add detailed information about the build and it will be
shown in a box as in the figure above. At this point we get accurate
feedback about our changes for every push to the repo. We can also look
if tests pass before approving or rejecting a pull request. Essentially
we have most of the functionality of full featured packages out
there.</p>
<h3 id="phase-5-store-each-build">Phase 5: Store Each Build</h3>
<p>But there is a piece missing. While we learn if tests pass, it is not
simple to cram all of the output (e.g.¬†which tests fail) into the
detailed information.</p>
<p>The right answer is to store all the build output in a database. We
use MongoDB since it is already installed on our servers. All we need is
to create a unique key for each build: one option is to use commit id,
but it can also be composed e.g.¬†of repo+branch+timestamp. Build output
is then stored in MongoDB using that key.</p>
<p>How is it read from GitHub? Easy! A new endpoint is created to access
any particular build, accessible from the outside as the URL:</p>
<pre><code>http://[server]/read/[key],</code></pre>
<p>When accessed it reads the build output with the given key and shows
it on a web page.</p>
<p>The missing link is how to access this build info from GitHub. When
the status is created this URL is added as <a
href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#create-a-status">target
URL</a>, which will be shown as a link to ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù in the drop down
box.</p>
<p>At this point we have a complete solution for continuous integration,
with limited deployments and GitHub integration. The system takes less
than 300 lines, with around 300 more of auxiliary code.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Our little project might be extended in many directions; here are
some of the most promising. Since I don‚Äôt work at Influencity any longer
it will have to be done by my colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="frontend-testing">Frontend Testing</h3>
<p>We had a similar setup for frontend code, but unfortunately the test
suite was very fragile and broke all the time. One of our pending items
was to make the frontend test suite more robust, and complete enough to
have the same confidence as with backend code.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-deployment">Continuous Deployment</h3>
<p>The system might be easily expanded to deploy directly to production.
In fact, as long as all changes are backwards compatible it is
straightforward to do: just deploy to integration and to production at
the same time. It was really more of a confidence thing: the team did
not feel comfortable pushing to production, so I left it as a future
improvement.</p>
<p>Of course it would be great to have further guarantees before
enabling continuous deployment. Automated rollbacks would also be a very
useful addition.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>Our little system had close to 600 lines of code, and four
dependencies: * <code>@octokit/rest</code>: to access the GitHub API. *
<code>aws-sdk</code>: to store deployment success or failure in AWs
CloudWatch. * <code>mongodb</code>: to store deployment info in MongoDB.
* <code>stdio</code>: to read the directory to run into from the command
line.</p>
<p>It could do everything that we needed for continuous integration.</p>
<p>Time spent creating it was more or less equivalent to installing and
configuring something like Jenkins or StriderCD. The system worked much
more reliably than Jenkins ever did for me, and knowing its inner
workings made it quite simpler to repair.</p>
<p>I have confidence that my colleagues will be able to work with (and
improve) our little script, since it is all Node.js code. The biggest
hurdle is to understand all of the different concepts involved in its
operation.</p>
<h3 id="code-release">Code Release</h3>
<p>I am not at liberty to publish the code which was all proprietary.
The ideas however are quite easy to reimplement independently, and may
be of use to other people.</p>
<p>If there is enough interest I will think about creating a clone. In
my opinion it will be more of a didactic tool than for production, since
configuring this thing may be a bit hard, but who knows?</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Too often we treat our tooling like black boxes which solve our
problems magically. But I have found that it is always a good idea to
invest some time to think about what we really need, and then look for a
solution.</p>
<p>By all means consider also the downsides of non-standard tooling: *
steep learning curve, * hard training.</p>
<p>But also consider the downsides of <em>standard</em> tooling: *
complex configuration, * mindless adoption, * hard maintenance.</p>
<p>I have written about the topic before if you are interested: <a
href="/2016/build-or-not">Should I Build or Should I Not</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to maintaining the tooling, everyone in the team should
know what it is doing behind the scenes. That way they will be able to
take over and even expand as needed, either with standard tools or
custom solutions.</p>
