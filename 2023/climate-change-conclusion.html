                    <p>After looking at a few options to help us deal with climate change, it‚Äôs now time to evaluate them in cold blood and see if they can make any difference. Then we will consider collective action and how to make it count.</p>
                    <h1 id="taking-action">Taking Action</h1>
                    <p>This will be a more militant post than those preceding it. Now is the time to take sides and to do something about it.</p>
                    <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
                    <p>Let us first do a comparative evaluation of the three solutions that have been considered so far: <a href="/2023/climate-change-trees">üå≤ planting trees</a>, <a href="/2023/climate-change-roofs">ü™© :mirror roofs</a>, and <a href="/2023/climate-change-screens">üõ∞Ô∏è space screens</a>. In reverse order for fun.</p>
                    <h3 id="space-screens">üõ∞Ô∏è Space Screens</h3>
                    <p>Sending <a href="/2023/climate-change-screens">a giant swarm of screens to space</a> can shield us from some of the Sun and reduce surface temperatures on Earth. This plan is actually not a solution, but at most a mitigation strategy that can buy us a few decades. There can be unforeseen consequences to reducing the amount of sunlight we receive; even more than most of these mega-infrastructure projects, it needs to be carefully considered to think about the consequences. Even the plan itself is full of incognitas, and it is not even clear that it is feasible with current technologies. There are in fact many alternative plans that have been proposed: from a single giant mirror to a swarm of small screens, with all intermediate possibilities.</p>
                    <p>But it is just possible that we will need to take mitigation actions before we can come up with a full solution. A small scale implementation can teach us a lot about the required technologies: space guns, satellite swarms, orbiting and de-orbiting stuff.</p>
                    <p>Having a viable and ready space gun can enable deep space exploration by humans: just send all the required materials and machines to orbit, assemble them up there, and then send the astronauts to board the finished product. Minimal cost and emissions would be required.</p>
                    <h3 id="mirror-roofs">ü™© Mirror Roofs</h3>
                    <p>Mandating mirror roofs can make us think about how to make cities more livable. Just yesterday I saw <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/URBAN-HEAT/zgpormdkevd/">this infographic by Reuters</a> which shows in a very impressive way the impact of trees and green in a city, and how asphalt makes our lives miserable. Lowering air conditioning requirements would also be a very welcome consequence.</p>
                    <h3 id="planting-trees">üå≤ Planting Trees</h3>
                    <p>Finally, we have to revert all the CO‚ÇÇ we have poured into the atmosphere, first unwittingly and later almost criminally.</p>
                    <h3 id="other-solutions">üîé Other Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Are these the most promising solutions for climate change? Not at all; I have chosen them because they are thought-provoking and fun to think about.</p>
                    <h2 id="my-contribution">My Contribution</h2>
                    <p>What do I intend to do? For starters, stop paying attention to those ‚Äúcarbon capture‚Äù supposedly high-tech projects, which I think are just lame attempts at fixing our problems with technology, when better solutions are right there in front of us. I may of course be wrong.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to fix our climate, but it will not be easy. The problem is getting bigger every year, so we really need to act now. A concerted effort by every government in the planet will be necessary. I sincerely hope that we spring to action before the situation is too severe.</p>
                    <p>I strongly believe that we should <em>immediately</em>: * switch to low-carbon energy sources, * start building nuclear power stations right away, * electrify transport urgently and switch to low-emissions construction techniques, * use the list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita">CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita</a> as a hall of shame, * raise sactions against the worst polluters.</p>
                    <p>In short, treat it as the worldwide emergency that it is now, and as the impending catastrophe that we may have upon us in a few decades.</p>
                    <h2 id="climate-change-skeptics">ü§¶ Climate Change Skeptics</h2>
                    <p>But first we need to convince everyone in the planet of the danger. Many people are denying the scientific and empirical evidence of climate change. Why is this?</p>
                    <h3 id="i-dont-want-to-believe">üôà I Don‚Äôt Want to Believe</h3>
                    <p>Why do some people not ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in climate change? Well, because they don‚Äôt want to! It‚Äôs as simple as that: it is uncomfortable to believe that our planet is being degraded fast by an invisible gas, that many of our descendents will have a hard time surviving in harsh conditions, and that the people that should be doing something about it are doing nothing; so they choose not to believe it.</p>
                    <p>The hard truth is that you don‚Äôt have to believe in something for it to happen. Things happen whether we believe in them or not, but we are so good at covering our eyes and ears when we hear things we don‚Äôt like that we may be unaware of a phenomenon until it punches us in the nose.</p>
                    <p>There is of course a concerted effort by interested parties (oil barons, carbon mine owners, energy companies, but even nuclear energy denialists) to convince us that there is no such climate change, or that it is not caused by us humans, or that it will not have bad consequences after all. But truth be told, they find fertile grounds in a lot of ignorant and misguided population.</p>
                    <p>Even worse, when these ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù are confronted with hard evidence, they will enter <a href="https://sharpenyouraxe.substack.com/p/three-guidelines-if-you-want-to-debate">cognitive dissonance</a> and go even deeper into their particular rabbit hole. Why? Because acknowledging that they were wrong in the first place would mean accepting that they have been wrong, and people don‚Äôt want to be ignorant.</p>
                    <h3 id="convincing-the-skeptics">ü§Ø Convincing the Skeptics</h3>
                    <p>So, what can we do about it?</p>
                    <p>In this regard, the quick changes in climate that we are witnessing right now can be a mixed blessing, as they are opening the eyes of many climate denialists. Making everyone participate of the challenges involved in turning the tide can perhaps help the general population to understand the huge efforts involved. The reversal of so many decades of reckless carbonization will involve sacrifices for everyone on the planet; probably changing our way of life, perhaps sacrifice some sacred cows. We need to be ready.</p>
                    <h2 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Climate change is upon us; every year we are breaking temperature records, and previously cool areas are becoming unbearable in summer. Taking carbon out of the atmosphere will help alleviate the most severe effects. We can start doing it right now, with low tech projects such as planting trees everywhere.</p>
                    <p>We can also get creative, like with mirror rooftop installations.</p>

                    <p>I have learned a lot speaking about these issues with many friends, including Juan Villamizar y Juan Searle.</p>
