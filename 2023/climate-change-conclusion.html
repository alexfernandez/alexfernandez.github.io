<p>After looking at a few options to help us deal with climate change,
it’s now time to evaluate them in cold blood and see if they can make
any difference. Then we will consider collective action and how to make
it count.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This will be a more militant post than
those preceding it. Because now is the time to take sides and do
something about it.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation">⚖️ Evaluation</h1>
<p>Let us first do a comparative evaluation of the three solutions that
have been considered so far: <a href="/2023/climate-change-trees">🌲
planting trees</a>, <a href="/2023/climate-change-roofs">🪩 mirror
roofs</a>, and <a href="/2023/climate-change-screens">🛰️ space
screens</a>. In reverse order for fun.</p>
<h2 id="space-screens">🛰️ Space Screens</h2>
<p>Sending <a href="/2023/climate-change-screens">screens to space</a>
can shield us from some of the Sun and reduce surface temperatures on
Earth. This plan is actually not a solution, but at most a mitigation
strategy that can buy us a few decades. There can be unforeseen
consequences to reducing the amount of sunlight we receive; even more
than most of these mega-infrastructure projects, it needs to be
carefully considered to think about the possible side-effects. Even the
plan itself is full of incognitas, and it is not even clear that it is
feasible with current technologies. There are in fact many alternative
options that have been proposed: from a single giant mirror to a huge
swarm of small screens, with all intermediate possibilities.</p>
<p>But it is just possible that we will need to take mitigation actions
before we can come up with a full solution. A small scale implementation
can teach us a lot about the required technologies: space guns,
satellite swarms, orbiting and de-orbiting stuff.</p>
<p>Having a viable and ready space gun can enable deep space exploration
by humans: just send all the required materials and machines to orbit,
assemble them up there, and then send the astronauts to board the
finished product. Minimal cost and emissions would be required. It is
about time that we have an alternative to the tired old rockets!</p>
<h2 id="mirror-roofs">🪩 Mirror Roofs</h2>
<p>Mandating <a href="/2023/climate-change-roofs">🪩 mirror roofs</a> on
top of buildings can make us think about how to make cities more
livable. Just yesterday I saw <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/URBAN-HEAT/zgpormdkevd/">this
infographic by Reuters</a> which shows in a very impressive way how
asphalt makes our lives in the city miserable. Lowering air conditioning
requirements would also be a very welcome consequence.</p>
<p>But the solutions explored go beyond mirror roofs: solar panels
shielding crops can bring surprising synergies: electricity generation
plus improved yields. The computations presented can guide us for
increasing the albedo of our cities, our countries and our planet, to
help cool the environment.</p>
<p>What is today just a convenience can become tomorrow the difference
between life and death for many people that cannot afford air
conditioning.</p>
<h2 id="planting-trees">🌲 Planting Trees</h2>
<p>Finally, at some point we will have to revert all the CO₂ we have
poured into the atmosphere, first unwittingly and later almost
criminally. By <a href="/2023/climate-change-trees">🌲 planting
trees</a> on a massive scale we can remove basically <strong>all the
excess carbon</strong> in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This is in my opinion our best chance. We need a huge concerted scale
from all governments on Earth: planting new dense forests on 30% of the
land surface is not going to be easy politically. But the technical
difficulties are well known and solvable.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty is in fact to find enough room to plant so
many trees. Just by chance deserts make up exactly 33% of the land
surface, but making them green once more can be quite hard. Instead,
just planting semi-arid areas would get us more than half the way.
Taking my home country of Spain as an example, it can be done in a few
decades.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see so many people that are skeptical to this
project, and that basically see it as hippie hand-waving. I believe that
many people have too much faith in high-tech. Forget about “carbon
capture technologies”; trees are our best ally, as they have been for
millions of years.</p>
<h2 id="other-solutions">🔎 Other Solutions</h2>
<p>Are these the most promising solutions for climate change? Not at
all; I have chosen them because they are thought-provoking and fun to
think about.</p>
<p>Project Drawdown has a <a
href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions">list of
solutions</a> which are viable right now and which combined can have a
huge impact: between 1000 and 1600 gigatons of CO₂. Remember that we are
dealing with some 1600 gigatons of excess CO₂ in the atmosphere, or
about 400 gigatons of carbon (since each molecule of CO₂ only has ~27%
of carbon in weight). They range from <a
href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/bamboo-production">planting
bamboo</a> to <a
href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/clean-cooking">stop cooking with
carbon</a>, with many other ideas,</p>
<p>Most of the projects are a bit too pedestrian to have fun thinking
about them, though. But they still are necessary: both pedestrian and
outlandish projects have a role to play. In my opinion we will need all
the help we can get.</p>
<h1 id="taking-action">💪 Taking Action</h1>
<p>Now let’s see what courses of action we have available, and if they
are any good.</p>
<h2 id="climate-change-skeptics">🤦 Climate Change Skeptics</h2>
<p>First we need to convince everyone on the planet of the danger. Many
people are denying the scientific and empirical evidence of climate
change. Why?</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-want-to-believe">🙈 I Don’t Want to Believe</h3>
<p>Why do some people not “believe” in climate change? Well, because
they don’t want to! It’s as simple as that: it is uncomfortable to
believe that our planet is being degraded fast by an invisible gas, that
many of our descendents will have a hard time surviving in harsh
conditions, and that the people that should be doing something about it
are doing nothing; so they choose not to believe it.</p>
<p>The hard truth is that you don’t have to believe in something for it
to happen. Things happen whether we believe in them or not, but we are
so good at covering our eyes and ears when we hear things we don’t like
that we may be unaware of a phenomenon until it punches us in the
nose.</p>
<p>There is of course a concerted effort by interested parties (oil
barons, carbon mine owners, energy companies, but even nuclear energy
denialists) to convince us that there is no such climate change, or that
it is not caused by us humans, or that it will not have bad consequences
after all. But truth be told, they find fertile grounds in high numbers
of misguided population.</p>
<p>Even worse, when these “skeptics” are confronted with hard evidence,
they will enter <a
href="https://sharpenyouraxe.substack.com/p/three-guidelines-if-you-want-to-debate">cognitive
dissonance</a> and go even deeper into their particular rabbit hole.
Why? Because acknowledging that they were wrong in the first place would
mean accepting that they were misguided, and people don’t want to appear
ignorant.</p>
<h3 id="convincing-the-skeptics">🤯 Convincing the Skeptics</h3>
<p>So, what can we do about it?</p>
<p>In this regard, the quick changes in climate that we are witnessing
right now can be a mixed blessing, as they are opening the eyes of many
climate denialists. Making everyone participate of the challenges
involved in turning the tide can perhaps help the general population
understand the huge efforts involved. The reversal of so many decades of
reckless carbonization will involve sacrifices for everyone on the
planet; probably changing our way of life, perhaps sacrifice some sacred
cows.</p>
<p>We need to be ready.</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up-our-act">🚯 Cleaning Up Our Act</h2>
<p>But the most important action we can take is not to solve the
existing problem: it is to stop the problem from growing even bigger. Up
to now we have not stopped releasing CO₂ into the atmosphere, far from
it: we are emitting more than ever, and <strong>the rate is
increasing</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/climate-change-emissions.png"
title="CO₂ emissions from 1900 to 2021. Raising almost linearly from 1940 to 2020, a small dip in 2020 from 37 to 35 gigatons, then up again to 37 in 2021."
alt="CO₂ emissions are still growing. Yes, we are that clever. Source: Our World in Data." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">CO₂ emissions are still growing. Yes, we
are that clever. <a
href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions">Source: Our World in
Data</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We need to switch to low carbon energy sources, quick. And our best
bet right now seems to be <a
href="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-energy">nuclear energy</a>. It
is safe (one death since 1986), clean and can scale up to fulfill our
needs. Yes, it can be expensive; but meanwhile we are gambling on our
planet.</p>
<p>This excellent book from Alfredo García is sadly only in Spanish: <a
href="https://www.planetadelibros.com/libro-la-energia-nuclear-salvara-el-mundo/312496">Nuclear
Energy Will Save the World</a>. Thankfully, the world seems to be
warming up to the idea of nuclear power, despite some holdouts from the
1980s like (shame) <a
href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/52758/reasons-why-nuclear-energy-not-way-green-and-peaceful-world/">Greenpeace</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, renewable energy is great and all, but sometimes there is no
wind at night. Until we find a way to safely and conveniently store
energy, we need to do something <strong>now</strong>. And that something
is nuclear fission.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<p>Climate change is upon us; every year we are breaking temperature
records, and previously cool areas are becoming unbearable in summer.
Taking carbon out of the atmosphere will help alleviate the most severe
effects. We can start doing it right now, with low tech projects such as
planting trees everywhere.</p>
<p>We can also get creative, like with mirror rooftop installations.
Getting people involved in climate change mitigation projects is going
to play an important role to fight this emergency on a planetary scale.
In a few decades we will all be a part of it, like it or not.</p>
<h2 id="my-contribution">☝️ My Contribution</h2>
<p>What do I intend to do? For starters, stop paying attention to those
supposedly high-tech projects like “carbon capture” or “nuclear fusion”:
I think they are just lame attempts at fixing our problems with
technology, when better solutions are right there in front of us. I may
of course be wrong as I have often been in the past, so you can keep an
eye on those projects too if you want.</p>
<p>It is possible to fix our climate, but it will not be easy. The
problem is getting bigger every year, so we really need to act now. A
concerted effort by every government on the planet will be necessary. I
sincerely hope that we spring to action before the situation is too
severe.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that we should <em>immediately</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>laugh out of office any policitians that minimize or outright deny
climate change,</li>
<li>switch to low-carbon energy sources,</li>
<li>take remediation actions seriously,</li>
<li>start building nuclear power stations right away,</li>
<li>electrify transport urgently and switch to low-emissions
construction techniques,</li>
<li>use the list of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita">CO₂
emissions per capita</a> as a hall of shame,</li>
<li>raise sactions against the worst polluters.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, treat it as the worldwide emergency that it is now, and as
the impending catastrophe that we may have upon us in a few decades. My
contribution will be small, and perhaps yours will be too, but together
we can fix this mess.</p>
