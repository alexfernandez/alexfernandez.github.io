										<h1>🪽 Avis Æterna</h1>
										<p>🛩️ A Perpetual Flying Machine<p>
									</header>
																				<p>From the beginning of time people have wanted to
                    fly. Nowadays there are a multitude of flying
                    machines, from regular airline planes to helicopters
                    and more recently drones. And sometimes even blimps
                    and ballons may appear like relics from the past.
                    Sadly, the amazing flying ships that appear in the
                    movies of Hideo Miyazaki have not materialized yet:
                    they hover endlessly and never seem to have to touch
                    down for fuel.</p>
                    <p>Down in the real world, some people have also
                    dreamt of air ships that stay in the air forever,
                    both for their inspiring qualities and for practical
                    reasons like scientific missions or broadband
                    service. There are some promising approaches that
                    are on the brink of permanent flight. In this
                    article we will explore the <em>avis æterna</em>, a
                    novel approach that might be able to one day fulfill
                    the dream.</p>

                    an avis æterna.</figcaption>

                    <h1 id="the-idea">💡 The Idea</h1>
                    <p>The time is ripe for a drone that can stay aloft
                    indefinitely. The designs that hold all current <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_endurance_record">flight
                    endurance records</a> are a fixed wing airplane with
                    solar panels during the day, and batteries to store
                    the energy at night. There is a clear tradeoff that
                    centers around the size of the batteries: too big
                    and it will require a lot of energy to fly, too
                    small and they will not last all night. We are just
                    waiting for sufficiently efficient solar panels and
                    light enough batteries.</p>
                    <p>But other approaches can be explored. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon">Atmospheric
                    balloons</a> are known to stay aloft for days and
                    even weeks. We could build a plane which is made
                    lighter by hydrogen, which can also be used as fuel
                    storage: instead of being weighed down by batteries
                    it could be filled with hydrogen which makes it
                    lighter. Not lighter than air, but sufficiently
                    lighter that it is easy to stay up. Even better,
                    hydrogen can be extracted directly from the air!</p>
                    <p>Now, I am not an industrial engineer: I studied
                    Physics and have been working with computers for a
                    couple of decades. But I like to explore if a
                    concept is at least feasible from a physical point
                    of view, and if the technology is there yet or
                    requires further developments. You may remember my
                    previous attemps at a <a
                    href="http://pinchito.es/2018/building-space-launcher">space
                    launcher</a> or <a
                    href="http://pinchito.es/2023/climate-change-trees">helping
                    the climate change crisis with trees</a>. In this
                    article I will do some <a
                    href="/2023/climate-change-solutions#fermi-estimation">Fermi
                    estimations</a> to check if the parameters are at
                    least in the right ballpark. Don’t expect detailed
                    plans or a bill of materials though; this part will
                    have to be undertaken by an enterprising soul with a
                    lot more practical knowledge than I may have or hope
                    to acquire. So let’s explore the idea together from
                    our comfy armchairs!</p>
                    <h2 id="inspiration">😶‍🌫️ Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>The albatross is an amazing bird: it only ever
                    touches ground to mate on some remote island. It is
                    not clear if it ever rests in the sea where it is
                    vulnerable, but it seems that it can do everything
                    in flight, like <a

                    </figure>
                    <p>The Wikipedia article for <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_endurance_record">flight
                    endurance record</a> clearly separates records for
                    airplanes (64 days), balloons (19 days) and airships
                    (11 days). So why not combine the three
                    categories?</p>
                    <p>Hydrogen storage has the advantage that it can
                    make our avis æterna lighter and easier to keep
                    aloft. No longer do we need to support its full
                    weight with lift produced by its wings. Since
                    hydrogen gas has around <a
                    href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/tech_validation/pdfs/fcm01r0.pdf">7%
                    of the density of air</a>, a hydrogen chamber will
                    make the avis lighter. But not necessarily lighter
                    than air, which would make it an <a

                    In fact, the avis may be able to control its weight
                    by expanding its hydrogen chamber. I would think of
                    it as the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_bladder">swim

                    their buoyancy in water.</p>

                    <p>Let’s delve deeper into this accident. First, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_disaster">only
                    35 of the 97 people aboard died</a>, which is
                    surprising given the magnitude of the fire. Then
                    there are suspicions that the materials of the
                    enclosure were at least partly responsible for the
                    quick fire; the thermite theory has been <a
                    href="https://spot.colorado.edu/~dziadeck/zf/LZ129fire2005jan12.pdf">thoroughly
                    debunked by experts</a>. Nonetheless the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVV7olFdg5I">Mythbusters
                    in S04Ep3</a> did some suggestive experiments that
                    gave a substantive role to the coating of the
                    enclosure.</p>
                    <p>In any case, hydrogen is now safer to use than at
                    any other time in history. We should be open to
                    experiment again with that awesome, fully renewable
                    gas. Especially when no people are in danger! The
                    avis æterna will be fully autonomous, which should
                    also be good training for crewed hydrogen
                    planes.</p>
                    <h2 id="previous-designs">📝 Previous Designs</h2>
                    <p>Airbus is the current record holder with its <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_Zephyr">Zephyr
                    series</a>. It has been flying non-stop for 64 days,
                    until a stratospheric current out of nowhere took it
                    down.</p>
                    <p>Even Facebook did an experimental plane once with
                    the idea of bringing Internet connectivity to the
                    unwashed masses, the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Aquila">Facebook
                    Aquila</a>, as can be seen in <a

                    video</a>.</p>
                    <p>With this kind of electric design the problem
                    lies in the weight of the batteries, needed to keep
                    the plane flying at night. Holding more charge means
                    more weight, which drives up the requirements.</p>
                    <h1 id="the-design">🧑‍💻 The Design</h1>
                    <p>The basic idea is to have a hybrid of plane,
                    airship and balloon. It is to be filled with
                    hydrogen gas H₂ at atmospheric pressure, which will
                    lift some but not all of its own weight; leaving a
                    portion of its total to be supported by lift as it
                    moves forward.</p>
                    <h2 id="flying-wing">🪽 Flying Wing</h2>
                    <p>The concept of a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_wing">flying
                    wing</a> has been around for a while. Some people
                    think that it is <a
                    href="https://hackaday.com/2021/08/08/from-tube-and-wing-to-just-wing-the-future-of-airliners/">the
                    future of air travel</a>, with its more efficient
                    design.</p>
                    <p>A flying wing also has more internal storage than
                    a classic plane. The mostly flat top surface is
                    ideal for placing light-weight solar panels, which
                    provide electricity for its operation. We are
                    envisioning a rather bulky aircraft similar to the
                    design below, given suitable aerodynamics. Our
                    reference design is 10 meters long and wide and
                    stands 5 meters high.</p>

                    <p>Remember that this design doesn’t need to be as
                    aerodynamic as a regular plane: it only has to
                    generate enough lift when flying to compensate a
                    small part of its entire weight, since a
                    considerable portion will be sustained by
                    buoyancy.</p>
                    <p>At sea level <a
                    href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/atmosphere/atmospheric-pressure/air-mass-dens">air
                    weighs around 1.3 kg/m³</a>, while <a

                    weighs 70 g/m³</a>; providing a good 1.2 kg of
                    buoyancy per cubic meter of stored hydrogen.</p>
                    <p>Hydrogen gas can be very easily extracted from
                    water using electrolysis. It is also very possible,
                    although not as easy, to extract water from air:
                    just condensing atmospheric water vapor, which can
                    be done using an <a

                    water generator</a>. There are many possible
                    mechanisms; a suitable light-weight design should be
                    used, which might take advantage of air passing
                    through the two big fans at the top that give
                    propulsion.</p>

                    <p>Some way of storing electricity for the night
                    must be provided, if we are to stay aloft. There are
                    several possibilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Carry along some measure of batteries, just as
                    existing designs. This is not the preferred choice
                    because they are heavy and bulky.</li>
                    <li>Just float: store enough hydrogen so that the
                    avis becomes buoyant in the atmosphere. The frame
                    can expand with the gas. Another possibility which
                    would allow a rigid body is to store water as
                    ballast during the day, and release it at sunset.
                    This is a low cost solution that can be good
                    enough.</li>
                    <li>Use part of the stored H₂ as fuel for a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell">hydrogen
                    cell</a>. This is the preferred solution, but
                    requires to develop fuel cells which are both light
                    and efficient enough. The avis can store extra
                    hydrogen during the day, which will increase its
                    internal pressure (or volume) enough to have some
                    reserves.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="challenges">💪 Challenges</h2>
                    <p>There are some areas which may require advancing
                    the state of the art.</p>
                    <h3 id="extracting-hydrogen-from-air">💧 Extracting
                    Hydrogen from Air</h3>
                    <p>The core of our design is storing hydrogen
                    molecules. How can we lay our hands on those sweet
                    H₂ molecules? We have set our hopes on <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_water_generator">atmospheric
                    water generators</a>, but these are currently heavy
                    and waste a lot of power.</p>
                    <p>Since oxygen is much denser than hydrogen, water
                    is only <a
                    href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Ancillary_Materials/Exemplars_and_Case_Studies/Exemplars/Biology/Atomic_Weights_and_Water">1/9
                    hydrogen in weight</a>. Therefore each kg of H₂
                    requires 9 kg of H₂O. It is not feasible to carry
                    this much water onboard, except as ballast.</p>
                    <p>This becomes especially problematic in dry areas
                    and as we raise higher in the atmosphere. We have
                    the advantage that we are passing a lot of air
                    through our propeller fans already, which can help
                    collect water with a bit of temperature gradient. So
                    there is at least hope.</p>
                    <h3 id="manipulating-hydrogen">🎈 Manipulating
                    Hydrogen</h3>
                    <p>Hydrogen gas (H₂) is notably hard to contain:
                    there will be leaks everywhere no matter what we use
                    to contain it. Therefore it needs to be replenished
                    in flight, as we have seen.</p>
                    <p>Gas should be as close to atmospheric pressure as
                    possible, to prevent even worse leaks. The enclosure
                    may be elastic to hold a variable amount of gas, or
                    it might be rigid.</p>
                    <p>Any leaks become really problematic in the
                    presence of electrical sparks, which must be
                    contained as much as possible. For instance <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire">St. Elmo’s
                    fire</a> is suspected in the Hindenburg disaster.
                    Also, air leaks inside the enclosure will mix the H₂
                    with O₂ and turn the insides into a ticking
                    bomb.</p>
                    <h3 id="propulsion">🛩️ Propulsion</h3>
                    <p>Propellers are <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller_%28aeronautics%29">light
                    and efficient</a>, so they should not be an issue as
                    long as we have enough power. Moving forward should
                    not be too hard.</p>
                    <p>Control surfaces are required to direct flight to
                    any desired direction, and to regulate height
                    efficiently. This will be a challenge to the
                    external design; any clumsy attempts from my part
                    will just highlight the defficiencies.</p>
                    <p>Moving parts should be avoided for a really
                    perpetual flying machine. Some kind of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_wind">ionic
                    wind</a> might be explored as an alternative means
                    of propulsion with less maintenance and longer
                    endurance.</p>

                    above 20 km (70k ft). And so it is for most of the
                    competition.</p>
                    <p>There are a lot of advantages for flying
                    high:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Good weather: no storms in the

                    <li>Clear skies: no commercial flights.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But for the avis æterna design it is a serious
                    disadvantage:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Less weight of the displaced air means less
                    lift: at 15 km high the atmosphere is <a

                    times less dense</a> than at sea level.</li>
                    <li>Less water vapor to harvest water (and hydrogen)
                    from: it can be really scarce in the <a

                    law</a> is on our side: in principle we only need to
                    scale the design up to have enough buoyancy at any
                    height. The water vapor issue remains a problem
                    though, and may have to be tackled gradually.</p>

                    <p>Let’s do some <a
                    href="/2023/climate-change-solutions#fermi-estimation">Fermi
                    estimations</a> to verify if the idea is feasible,
                    at least in principle: we estimate the order of
                    magnitude of each parameter and see if they make
                    sense together.</p>
                    <p>Remember that our reference design is 10m long.
                    The <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">cube-square
                    law</a> means that we can scale our design up and
                    down, changing the compromises. Weight will in
                    general play in our favor for bigger versions:
                    volume grows with l³ while surface grows with l², so
                    our design will behave better as we make it
                    bigger.</p>
                    <h2 id="lift-revisited">🛫 Lift Revisited</h2>
                    <p>The total holding volume would be length by width
                    by height, multiplied by some factor <code>f</code>
                    that depends on the actual shape:</p>
                    <pre><code>V = f × l × w × h.</code></pre>
                    <p>If the shape was a simple box the factor would be
                    1; let us suppose that it is somehow shaped like a
                    drop of water. For a sphere the factor is around
                    .523, or really close to one half, so we can go with
                    <code>f=½</code>. In our case the width and length
                    are similar and the height is around the length, so
                    we get:</p>
                    <pre><code>V ≈ l³/4.</code></pre>
                    <p>With a reference length of 10m we get:</p>
                    <pre><code>V ≈ 250 m³.</code></pre>
                    <p>How much weight can it lift? A cubic meter of air
                    weighs around <a
                    href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/atmosphere/atmospheric-pressure/air-mass-density">1.3
                    kg</a>, while if filled with hydrogen it drops to <a
                    href="https://genh2hydrogen.com/blog/defining-hydrogen-from-a-to-z-3/">70
                    grams</a>. Therefore every cubic meter will provide
                    a lift of about 1.2 kg. Total lift <code>L</code>
                    when full of hydrogen will be:</p>
                    <pre><code>L ≈ V × 1.2 kg/m³.</code></pre>
                    <p>In our reference length of 10m:</p>
                    <pre><code>L ≈ 250 × 1.2 kg ≈ 300 kg.</code></pre>
                    <h2 id="weight-revisited">⚖️ Weight Revisited</h2>
                    <p>The total weight can be computed as a factor of
                    size, considering how the structure is constructed.
                    It is interesting to note that, as in the blimps of
                    old, the interior of the avis can be completely
                    empty: we only need to consider its surface if it’s
                    rigid enough to self-sustain. The total surface area
                    <code>A</code> can be roughly computed as top,
                    bottom and back of the wing. If we follow the
                    CyberTruck school of industrial design we can mock
                    our structure as a low-polygon version, as follows:
                    two triangles on top and bottom, and a diamond at
                    the back.</p>
                    <figure>
                    <img src="pics/avis-aeterna-low-poly.png"
                    title="Low-polygon version of the design: rhomboid in the back, two triangles on top and two on the bottom."

                    æterna.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>For our crude Fermi estimation we don’t even need
                    such sophistication: the top and bottom structures
                    can just be approximated by one triangle each, and
                    we will be within a factor 2 of the true value. The
                    back rhomboid is easy: just half the area of the
                    rectangle. On top of this we add 50% for safety:</p>
                    <pre><code>A = A(top) + A(bottom) + A(back)
≈ 1.5 × (2 × l × w / 2 + w × h / 2)
≈ 1.5 × w × (l + h / 2).</code></pre>
                    <p>Again with our 10m version:</p>
                    <pre><code>A = 1.5 × 10 × (10 + 5 / 2) m²
≈ 187 m².</code></pre>
                    <p>Now the thickness and density of the material are
                    tricky: it needs to self-sustain but also to
                    withstand air currents. For a good approximation
                    within the realm of possibility let’s look at <a

                    weight of 50 kg, or an areal density of 3.5 kg/m².
                    If we extrapolate to our area:</p>
                    <pre><code>W ≈ 3.5 kg/m² × 187 m² ≈ 700 kg.</code></pre>
                    <p>We can consider this number as an upper limit
                    since an ultralight plane has to withstand much
                    bigger forces than the avis. For a lower limit we
                    can turn to the more experimental <a

                    kg for a much more reasonable areal density of 1
                    kg/m². This would give us:</p>
                    <pre><code>W ≈ 1 kg/m² × 187 m² ≈ 200 kg.</code></pre>
                    <p>This weight could be self-supported by the lift,

                    <p>Solar power will depend on the top area of the
                    wing <code>A(top)</code>, and the areal power of the
                    solar cells used. We can very roughly approximate
                    the top area as a triangle:</p>
                    <pre><code>A(top) ≈ l × w / 2 ≈ l² / 2.</code></pre>

                    arrays</a> with a yield “greater than 350 W/m²”. If
                    the top surface is completely filled with solar
                    cells this gives:</p>
                    <pre><code>P = 350 W / m² × A(top)
≈ 350 W/m² / (l² / 2).</code></pre>
                    <p>So for instance with <code>l=10m</code> we
                    get:</p>
                    <pre><code>P ≈ 350 W/m² × 50 m² ≈ 17.5 kW.</code></pre>
                    <p>Again MicroLink says that their specific power is
                    “more than 1500 W/kg”, so the total weight of the
                    solar cells would be:</p>
                    <pre><code>W(solar) ≈ 17.5 kW / (1500 W/kg)
≈ 12 kg.</code></pre>
                    <p>I would say this is very reasonable for a full
                    solar panel cover. It needs to be able to power up
                    both the propellers and the hydrogen generator.</p>

                    avis <code>W(H₂)</code> will be:</p>
                    <pre><code>W(H₂) = V × 70 g/m3.</code></pre>
                    <p>For our reference 10m length:</p>
                    <pre><code>W(H₂) = 250 m3 × 70 g/m3
= 17.5 kg.</code></pre>
                    <p>How much water do we really need? <a
                    href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Ancillary_Materials/Exemplars_and_Case_Studies/Exemplars/Biology/Atomic_Weights_and_Water">About
                    9 times more</a>. In our case:</p>
                    <pre><code>W(water) = 9 × W(H₂)
≈ 9 × 17.5 kg ≈ 150 kg.</code></pre>
                    <p>Now that is a lot of water! We can extract water
                    from thin air as we need it, using an <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_water_generator">atmospheric
                    water generator</a>. But these things are huge and
                    heavy. Just for the sake of argument, let’s look at
                    <a
                    href="https://time.com/75612/atmospheric-water-generator-watergen/">this
                    device</a>. Generating one liter of water (around a
                    kg) takes 310 watt-hours, so for each kg of hydrogen
                    it would take 9 times more:</p>
                    <pre><code>P(kg) ≈ 9 × 310 Wh ≈ 2.8 kWh.</code></pre>
                    <p>Next we need to extract the hydrogen from the
                    water. The <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water#Industrial_output">industrial
                    efficiency</a> using electrical energy is at around
                    55 kWh per kg of hydrogen generated. Adding the
                    approx 3 kWh to extract the water first from the
                    atmosphere we get 58 kWH per kg of hydrogen.</p>
                    <p>In our reference 10m design we computed that we
                    can count on 17.5 kW from the solar cells, so we can
                    generate one kg of hydrogen every 3.5 hours. As we
                    saw above filling its 250 m3 volume would take 17.5
                    kg at atmospheric pressure, and could be filled in
                    ~60 hours of continuous operation.</p>
                    <p>In reality part of the power will be directed to
                    the propellers. It remains to be seen if such a rate
                    of hydrogen generation is enough to replenish any
                    leaks.</p>
                    <h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Dreaming outside your area of expertise has
                    brought about endless innovations, and in fact is
                    the main source of inquiry into those areas where
                    there are no experts yet. Plus, it is cheap and
                    fun!</p>
                    <p>In this case, several advancements in different
                    areas can be joined together to make a powerful new
                    invention: an airship that does not need to touch
                    ground, which is heavier than air (but that uses
                    partial buoyancy to stay aloft), and which can still
                    go whenever it needs to go. Even a 10-meter
                    reference design comparable to a small plane might
                    be a viable avis æterna.</p>
                    <p>The <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjBgEkbnX2Ia">golden
                    age of airships</a> may be in our future, and there
                    are so many possibilities that only redoing old
                    concepts, and not exploring alternative designs,
                    would be really sad.</p>
