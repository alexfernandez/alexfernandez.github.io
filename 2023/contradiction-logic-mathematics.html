<p>In the <a href="/2023/contradiction-what-is">first part</a> we have
seen how contradiction is not as easy to pinpoint as we would like. So
now we ask ourselves: can we make a rock-solid definition of what a
contradiction is in mathematics, or at least in logic? We will try
here.</p>
<h2 id="logic-contradiction">≢ Logic Contradiction?</h2>
<p>We saw before that a contradiction in logic is simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A contradiction means asserting that a statement and its contrary are
true.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="introduction-to-logic">Introduction to Logic</h3>
<p>Cool, but what is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</a>? It is a branch of
philosophy (or mathematics, depending on who you ask) that studies the
truth of statements, without entering on what those statements actually
mean.</p>
<p>We want to formalize logic to be able to speak about it in symbols:
for instance, if we have a statement <code>A</code> (whatever
<code>A</code> may mean), we will speak about whether <code>A</code> is
true. <code>A</code> can mean “my dog is beautiful” or “Petra speaks
about stained glass”; we don’t care much.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful symbol <code>¬</code> which means “not” in
logic. So to negate <code>A</code> we will say <code>¬A</code>, which
means the opposite of <code>A</code>. So if <code>A</code> is “my dog is
beautiful”, <code>¬A</code> means “my dog is <strong>not</strong>
beautiful”, which will make me very angry if I like my dog. But at this
level we are pure logicians and we don’t care about meaning.</p>
<p>We can combine it with the symbol <code>∧</code>, which means “and”;
now we can write a contradiction as:</p>
<pre><code>A ∧ ¬A</code></pre>
<p>which just means that both <code>A</code> and <code>¬A</code> are
true. There we have it!</p>
<h3 id="meaning-of-logic">🙉 Meaning of Logic</h3>
<p>At this point you may be thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can easily think of a sentence that can be true at the same time as
its opposite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s see: what if <code>A</code> is simply “It may rain”? Then we
can say very reasonably say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It may rain and it may not rain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to dig a bit deeper on what a logical statement is: not just
a random musing, but a rigorous statement. The favorite of logicians are
what <a
href="http://alexfernandez.local/2023/contradiction-what-is#ideas-and-properties">we
have called properties</a>, and which are formalized as “sets”: all
items belonging to a set have a certain property, and viceversa. So we
could speak about “the set of all blue things” (things that have the
“blue” property), or “the set of all horses” (things that have the
“horseness” property), and so on.</p>
<p>Now it is harder to posit that something is blue and at the same time
it is not blue, given a sufficiently rigorous definition of “blue”. This
will be for now the way to go.</p>

<h3 id="rebuilding-maths">🏗️ Rebuilding Maths</h3>
<p>Let us take a step back. Why was formal logic needed?</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century many exceptional people were thinking
about how to rebuild the mighty structures of mathematics on more solid
grounds. For 2300 years mathematicians had based geometry on the
elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid">Euclid</a>;
algebra had been developed mightily since the times of the original arab
inventors but it had not been systematized. It was due time to formalize
all these branches on some elementary foundations.</p>
<p>First <a href="https://www.unav.es/gep/GrattanGuinness.pdf">algebra
was systematized in 1870</a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Peirce">Benjamin
Peirce</a>. In 1874 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>
published an article that started the field of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">set theory</a>. Soon
afterwards in 1889 number theory was systematized around <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">a few axioms</a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a>,
based on set theory.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century it was time to seek the logic
underpinnings of it all. A set of wonderful pioneers, including <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege">Gottlob Frege</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand
Russell</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead">Alfred
Whitehead</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>
along with Cantor who invented it all, formalized set theory and
mathematical logic. They introduced <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">first-order
logic</a>, which has symbols like <code>∀</code> “for all”,
<code>∃</code> “exists”, ∈ “belongs”.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-contradiction">🙅 Back to Contradiction</h3>
<p>Shortly after creating this system, in 1901 Russell brought out his
famous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">paradox</a>: if
we have the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves, does it
belong to itself? Sounds like a stupid question, but it brings up a
paradox. If it belongs to itself, then it doesn’t belong to the set
(itself); but if it doesn’t belong to itself, then it belongs to
itself.</p>
<p>In symbols:</p>
<pre><code>R = {x: x ∉ x}, R ∈ R ↔ R ∉ R</code></pre>
<p>This paradox brought the whole building down: according to the
principle of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum"><em>reductio
ad absurdum</em></a>, any chain of reasonings that result in a
contradiction mean that the initial suppositions are wrong. Therefore
there was something rotten in this logic system, and it had to be
fixed.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-mess">🩹 Fixing the Mess</h3>
<p>Intuitively it doesn’t seem very hard: just avoid specifying sets
that speak about themselves in the definition.</p>
<p>The task of rigorously axiomatizing set theory would fall on <a
href="Ernst%20Zermelo">Ernst Zermelo</a>, who along a few other
mathematicians and with the help of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">axiom of
choice</a>, would create the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory</a>: the standard formalization of set theory used today.</p>
<p>In essence, we are dealing with sets which behave like properties of
things: <code>x ∈ A</code> means that element <code>x</code> has a
certain property. In fact a set <code>P</code> can be defined as
containing all elements that have a certain property
<code>ψ()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>∀x: x ∈ P ↔ ψ(x)</code></pre>
<p>In words: for any element <code>x</code>, <code>x</code> belongs to
<code>P</code> implies that <code>ψ(x)</code> is true, and viceversa:
only elements for which <code>ψ(x)</code> is true can belong to
<code>P</code>.</p>
<p>Using these axioms we cannot define a property of belonging to
itself, we cannot define the set of all sets, and so on: we have avoided
the paradox.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">axiom of
choice</a> had to be added to deal with infinite sets: it says that it
is possible to pick an element from each set of a collection to create a
new set. It seems stupid and it took me many years to even grasp its
importance, but it is necessary for many derivations.</p>
<h2 id="rebuilding-maths-1">🏛️ Rebuilding Maths</h2>
<p>Once sound foundations for mathematics were laid out, it was time to
rebuild everything based on set theory.</p>
<p>This was part of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program">Hilbert’s
program</a> in the 1920s: setting a rigorous basis for all mathematics
based on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic">mathematical
logic</a> that was complete, consistent and could decide if any
statement is true.</p>
<h3 id="not-so-solid">🏚️ Not So Solid?</h3>
<p>The first cracks appeared when <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>
proved his famous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">incompleteness
theorems</a> in 1931: it is impossible to find the truth of all
statements with any set of axioms in a finite set of steps. But this was
just a minor inconvenience in the big scheme of things.</p>
<p>The problem of having a huge rigorous building built out of a small
set of principles is that it has to be <strong>completely
consistent</strong>: any contradiction that arises in any of its
branches means that the building is inconsistent. So we can look in the
darkest corners of mathematics looking for cracks, and any paradoxes we
find will <strong>invalidate the whole of mathematics</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us poke for a bit to see what we find.</p>
<h3 id="σ-ramanujan-summation">Σ Ramanujan Summation</h3>
<p>What do you think the sum of all positive numbers is going to be?</p>
<pre><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + ⋯ = ?</code></pre>
<p>It is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_summation">well known
result</a> from the Indian prodigy <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Srinivasa
Ramanujan</a> that the sum is -1/12:</p>
<pre><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + ⋯ = -1/12.</code></pre>
<p>The trivial proof is quite interesting as it involves a few infinite
series; you can see it in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF">Wikipedia
article</a>, or you can watch this <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww">excellent 7 minute
Numberphile video</a>.</p>
<p>This formula is not just a mathematical trick; a more rigorous proof
can be found by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_function_regularization">regularization
of the zeta function</a>. The result is used in physics to get
meaningful values of divergent series. It is a <strong>glaring
contradiction</strong>: the sum is divergent (tends to infinity), yet it
can be shown to converge (tends to a finite value).</p>
<pre><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ → ∞ ∧ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ = -1/12. </code></pre>
<h3 id="multiplying-spheres">🌐 Multiplying Spheres</h3>
<p>There is more. A very interesting result is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox">Banach–Tarski
paradox</a>, published in 1924: it is possible to break up a sphere into
a finite number of pieces, then reassemble them into <strong>two
identical spheres</strong>, therefore doubling the volume of the
original. The pieces are not stretched; just moved around and
rotated.</p>

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Banach-Tarski_Paradox.svg">bdesham
and Sean Kelly</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the pieces are not finite; each one has an infinite number
of points, so they are not “pieces” in the sense that we usually use:
you cannot just take your axe, chop up a sphere and reassemble the
pieces into two identical spheres.</p>
<p>Is this possible only with three-dimensional bodies? In fact <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von
Neumann</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_paradox">discovered in
1929</a> that the same trick can be done with a planar figure: take a
flat circle, divide it into parts, move and turn those parts, and then
reassemble them into two flat circles.</p>
<p>Again we have a contradiction: by taking a solid figure, dividing it
up in pieces and applying only transformations that do not change the
area, we have changed the area.</p>
<h3 id="pinpointing-the-problem">♾️ Pinpointing the Problem</h3>
<p>So, is there any principle in mathematics which is particularly
problematic, and that we can leave out to avoid contradictions, keeping
the rest?</p>
<p>In fact there is! It would seem that dealing with infinites is
problematic: adding infinite series, chopping up figures in sets with
infinite points. But infinites were introduced, remember, to help deal
with paradoxes like those of Zenon: Achilles running after the turtle
but never reaching it because he had to run an inifinite number of
steps. In particular, mathematicians have pinpointed the trouble to the
same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">axiom of
choice</a> that was introduced in set theory to help deal with sets with
infinite elements.</p>
<p>Can we rebuild mathematics without the axiom of choice? Apparently
it’s so useful that mathematicians don’t want to give it up! According
to wikipedia there have been some efforts to reconstruct mathematics
without it, like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)">constructivism</a>,
but they are not very popular.</p>
<p>Therefore, if modern mathematics lead to contradiction, we should
reject all of it in a giant exercise of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum"><em>reductio
ad absurdum</em></a>. And then rebuild all of it with different
foundations. But not many people seem to be willing to do it because it
is boring?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h2>
<p>We came to logic and mathematics looking for eternal truth, and we
find contradictions hidden in the corners. I am sure any professional
mathematician can relate many other paradoxes that result in
contradictions.</p>
<p>Do I want to conclude, as many laypeople say, that logic and
mathematics are useless, since they incur in contradictions? Not at all;
I think that, with all their faults, logic and mathematics can help us
think more efficiently. Being able to identify contradiction is a very
helpful skill, even if sometimes we have to accept it.</p>
<p>But it is still an interesting fact that even logicians and
mathematicians have to accept a little contradiction in their wonderful
thought cathedrals, as long as they are not too bothersome.</p>

paradoxes as a kid, and for the many discussions afterwards.</p>
