                    <p>In the <a href="/2023/contradiction-what-is">first part</a> we have seen how contradiction is not as easy to pinpoint as we would like. So now we ask ourselves: can we make a rock-solid definition of what a contradiction is in mathematics, or at least in logic? We will try here.</p>
                    <h2 id="logic-contradiction">≢ Logic Contradiction?</h2>
                    <p>We saw before that a contradiction in logic is simply:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>A contradiction means asserting that a statement and its contrary are true.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h3 id="introduction-to-logic">Introduction to Logic</h3>
                    <p>Cool, but what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</a>? It is a branch of philosophy (or mathematics, depending on who you ask) that studies the truth of statements, without entering on what those statements actually mean.</p>
                    <p>We want to formalize logic to be able to speak about it in symbols: for instance, if we have a statement <code>A</code> (whatever <code>A</code> may mean), we will speak about whether <code>A</code> is true. <code>A</code> can mean “my dog is beautiful” or “Petra speaks about stained glass”; we don’t care much.</p>
                    <p>There is a beautiful symbol <code>¬</code> which means “not” in logic. So to negate <code>A</code> we will say <code>¬A</code>, which means the opposite of <code>A</code>. So if <code>A</code> is “my dog is beautiful”, <code>¬A</code> means “my dog is <strong>not</strong> beautiful”, which will make me very angry if I like my dog. But at this level we are pure logicians and we don’t care about meaning.</p>
                    <p>We can combine it with the symbol <code>∧</code>, which means “and”, we can write a contradiction as:</p>
                    <pre><code>A ∧ ¬A</code></pre>
                    <p>which just means that both <code>A</code> and <code>¬A</code> are true. There we have it!</p>
                    <h3 id="meaning-of-logic">🙉 Meaning of Logic</h3>
                    <p>At this point you may be thinking:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>I can easily think of a sentence that can be true at the same time as its opposite.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Let’s see: what if <code>A</code> is simply “It may rain”? Then we can say very reasonably say:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>“It may rain and it may not rain.”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h3 id="back-to-contradiction">🙅 Back to Contradiction</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of the 20th century many clever people were thinking about</p>
                    <h2 id="lets-try-maths">♾️ Let’s Try Maths</h2>
                    <h2 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Do I want to conclude, as many laypeople say, that logic and mathematics are useless, since they incur in contradictions? Not at all; I think that, with all their faults, logic and mathematics can help us think more efficiently. Being able to identify contradiction is a very helpful skill, even if sometimes we have to accept it.</p>

                    <p>I have to thank my brother Fernando for teaching me about simple logic paradoxes as a kid.</p>
