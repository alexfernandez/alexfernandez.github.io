                    <p>In the <a href="/2023/contradiction-what-is">first part</a> we have seen how contradiction is not as easy to pinpoint as we would like. So now we ask ourselves: can we make a rock-solid definition of what a contradiction is in mathematics, or at least in logic? We will try here.</p>
                    <h2 id="logic-contradiction">≢ Logic Contradiction?</h2>
                    <p>We saw before that a contradiction in logic is simply:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>A contradiction means asserting that a statement and its contrary are true.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h3 id="introduction-to-logic">Introduction to Logic</h3>
                    <p>Cool, but what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</a>? It is a branch of philosophy (or mathematics, depending on who you ask) that studies the truth of statements, without entering on what those statements actually mean.</p>
                    <p>We want to formalize logic to be able to speak about it in symbols: for instance, if we have a statement <code>A</code> (whatever <code>A</code> may mean), we will speak about whether <code>A</code> is true. <code>A</code> can mean “my dog is beautiful” or “Petra speaks about stained glass”; we don’t care much.</p>
                    <p>There is a beautiful symbol <code>¬</code> which means “not” in logic. So to negate <code>A</code> we will say <code>¬A</code>, which means the opposite of <code>A</code>. So if <code>A</code> is “my dog is beautiful”, <code>¬A</code> means “my dog is <strong>not</strong> beautiful”, which will make me very angry if I like my dog. But at this level we are pure logicians and we don’t care about meaning.</p>
                    <p>We can combine it with the symbol <code>∧</code>, which means “and”, we can write a contradiction as:</p>
                    <pre><code>A ∧ ¬A</code></pre>
                    <p>which just means that both <code>A</code> and <code>¬A</code> are true. There we have it!</p>
                    <h3 id="meaning-of-logic">🙉 Meaning of Logic</h3>
                    <p>At this point you may be thinking:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>I can easily think of a sentence that can be true at the same time as its opposite.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Let’s see: what if <code>A</code> is simply “It may rain”? Then we can say very reasonably say:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>“It may rain and it may not rain.”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>We need to dig a bit deeper on what a logical statement is: not just a random musing, but a rigorous statement. The favorite of logicians are what <a href="http://alexfernandez.local/2023/contradiction-what-is#ideas-and-properties">we have called properties</a>, and which are formalized as “sets”: all items belonging to a set have a certain property, and viceversa. So we could speak about “the set of all blue things” (things that have the “blue” property), or “the set of all horses” (things that have the “horseness” property), and so on.</p>
                    <p>Now it is harder to posit that something is blue and at the same time it is not blue, given a sufficiently rigorous definition of “blue”. This will be for now the way to go.</p>

                    <p>Let us take a step back. When was formal logic created?</p>
                    <p>At the end of the 19th century many exceptional people were thinking about how to rebuild the mighty structures of mathematics on more solid grounds. For 2300 years mathematicians had based geometry on the elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid">Euclid</a>; algebra had been developed mightily since the times of the original arab inventors but it had not been systematized. It was due time to formalize all these branches on some elementary foundations. First <a href="file:///home/alex/Downloads/GrattanGuinness.pdf">algebra was systematized in 1870</a>, number theory was based on a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano">axioms by Peano</a>, and at the turn of the century it was time to seek the logic underpinnings of it all.</p>
                    <h3 id="back-to-contradiction">🙅 Back to Contradiction</h3>
                    <h2 id="rebuilding-maths-1">♾️ Rebuilding Maths</h2>
                    <p>Once the foundations for mathematics were laid out, it was time to rebuild them based on logic.</p>
                    <h3 id="back-to-contradiction-1">🙅 Back to Contradiction</h3>
                    <p>The problem of having a huge rigorous building built out of a small set of principles is that it has to be <strong>completely consistent</strong>: any contradiction that arises in any of its branches means that the building is inconsistent. So we can look in the darkest corners of mathematics looking for cracks, and any paradoxes we find will <strong>invalidate the whole of mathematics</strong>.</p>
                    <h3 id="section"></h3>
                    <h2 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Do I want to conclude, as many laypeople say, that logic and mathematics are useless, since they incur in contradictions? Not at all; I think that, with all their faults, logic and mathematics can help us think more efficiently. Being able to identify contradiction is a very helpful skill, even if sometimes we have to accept it.</p>

                    <p>I have to thank my brother Fernando for teaching me about simple logic paradoxes as a kid.</p>
