										<h1>üë∑ How I Searched for a Job</h1>
										<p>‚òùÔ∏è Worked for me, might work for you<p>
									</header>
																				<p>These are turbulent times when many workers are losing their jobs, and at the same time many companies are looking for workers. Some people have asked for advice in their job search; I will do my best to explain how I faced mine, the challenges that I met along the way and how to deal with them. In the hope that it will be useful should you find yourself in the same situation, or even myself in the (hopefully distant) future!</p>

                    <p>I will start with some lessons learned, and then explain them in the text <strong>in bold</strong>.</p>
                    <h1 id="the-job-search">The Job Search</h1>
                    <p>The whole process from first application to accepting an offer took roughly 7 weeks,</p>
                    <h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>The following lessons were useful to me.</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                    <li>Referrals work much better than cold applications.</li>
                    <li>Participate in the community for better exposure.</li>
                    <li>Have a clean, to the point CV.</li>
                    <li>Train like crazy for the jobs you are looking for.</li>
                    <li>Looking for a job is stressful.</li>
                    <li>Learn from your mistakes and move on.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2 id="yes-but-what-job">Yes, but What Job?</h2>
                    <p>It was roughly one year after joining NTRDE full time in September 2022; we had not got the financing we were looking for. My now ex-partners and I decided to split, so I had to find a proper job.</p>
                    <p>For the last four years I have been working as a CTO, thinking that I would be able to have more influence this way. But honestly I missed technical work a lot, as I had discovered this last year being a fullstack CTO (which means I did everything from product sketches to configuring servers to speaking with investors). Therefore I was ready to look for a job as individual contributor, no management responsibilities. As <a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/">Charity Majors likes to say</a>, the best managers are those that have engineered, but also the best engineers are those that have managed. I was ready to go back to sweet development work, baby!</p>
                    <h2 id="some-numbers">Some Numbers</h2>
                    <p>I sent out 44 job applications, although some of these came to me. I entered 14 selection processes with some human touch, beyond a mere email saying ‚Äúapplication received‚Äù or ‚Äúthanks but no thanks‚Äù. I participated in 8 technical challenges and was rejected all in all 15 times. On my side I cancelled 10 processes due to multiple reasons, and I was accepted for three positions. Another 16 applications are still pending as far as I know.</p>
                    <h2 id="publication">Publication</h2>
                    <p>At one point my job search was not looking good. I decided to do a publication on Twitter (I refuse to call it X). Even in its sunset years the blue bird still had a surprise for me. My <a href="https://twitter.com/pinchito/status/1692852099002827040">first tweet</a> had 36.4k views as of 2023-09-28, and was the post I remember with more retweets ever: 132 no less. Also 91 likes and 7 replies; total engagement is 0.6% in case you are wondering, computed as (likes + retweets + replies)/impressions, which for Tweeter is not bad.</p>
                    <p>This tweet got me 8 referrals, in fact for some of the most interesting job offers I would get. Just from the replies you can see DataDog, RevenueCat and TrustYou, and a few more were waiting for me in private messages. Even the same companies that had rejected me before with an email when I cold-applied would now give me an interview.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ask for referrals: they work much better than cold applications.</strong></p>
                    <p>A <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pinchito/110915846714273313">similar toot on Mastodon</a> got much less exposure, but still 15 retoots and one like.</p>
                    <p>I was lucky to get so much exposure, but it is also good to be known. I have been a Meetup organizer for 10 years, have organized several conferences and try to give talks regularly. When people see you around a lot they tend to infer that you are particularly clever, which is good (if untrue in this case). Yes, it is often ungrateful to get out of your house in the evening to go to a meetup, or writing conferencie proposals; but this effort will give fruit later.</p>
                    <p><strong>Participate in the community: it gives you exposure that will be useful when job searching.</strong></p>
                    <h2 id="cv">CV</h2>
                    <p>The <em>curriculum vitae</em>, ‚Äúr√©sum√©‚Äù or simply ‚Äúresume‚Äù is not something you write and then send 1000 times, or at least it should not be; I read about a <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-senior-engineer-em-job-search-story/">guy in NY</a> who updated his resume daily.</p>
                    <p>One of the companies where I applied required sending them a CV with two pages max, a single font and no pictures. I thought it was a really good idea so I crafted it using markdown and pandoc, and sent it to most US companies. I used to keep a longer form CV, but I took the time to unify it with the <a href="https://pinchito.es/cv">online CV</a> on this website. Technical details: it is generated as PDF using <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">pandoc</a>, using the very nice class <code>scrartcl</code> with small margins and blue links.</p>
                    <p>I have removed all the experience that is less pertinent from both, more aggressively for the shorter two-pager; both have a link to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinchito/">my LinkedIn page</a> if you need to account for every month of my career.</p>
                    <p>I also wrote many custom variations of the CV as needed; sometimes sites asked for text-only versions or sometimes just a cover letter highlighting my experience. The more effort you take for your application, the more likely it is that it will be considered.</p>
                    <p><strong>Write a simple lean CV and update it as needed.</strong></p>
                    <h2 id="selection-processes">Selection Processes</h2>
                    <p>Now we come to the most demanding part: all those selection processes, often including technical challenges: some with take-away assignments, others with online sessions.</p>
                    <h2 id="announcement">Announcement</h2>
                    <h3 id="linkedin-announcement">LinkedIn Announcement</h3>
                    <p>On LinkedIn I did not post that I was looking for a job since it did so well on Twitter. When I announced my hiring the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7112739360587866112/">post</a> had 2579 impressions as of 2023-09-28, with 83 reactions and 31 comments. Engagement was 4.4% in case you are wondering, computed as (reactions + comments) / impressions.</p>
                    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>The process of searching for a job can be really stressful. Don‚Äôt despair: you don‚Äôt need to find seven good jobs, one is enough.</p>
