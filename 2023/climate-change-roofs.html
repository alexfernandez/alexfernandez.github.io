																				<h2 id="mirror-roofs">🪩 Mirror Roofs</h2>
                    <p>Our second solution involves a little bit of creativity. Since the Earth is heated mainly by the Sun, why not divert some of that heat back to space?</p>
                    <p>Instead of installing dark roofs, like roofing tars, we may use a reflective cover. Apart from cooling the building itself, it will send those pesky infrared radiations back to space where they belong. It doesn’t even need to be a proper mirror, just some kind of surface that reflects light in the infrared spectrum. We don’t need an expensive <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html">gold foil</a>; just <a href="https://osb.westfraser.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Physics-of-Foil.pdf">aluminium foil</a> is a good mirror for infrared light.</p>

                    <img src="pics/climate-change-mirrors.jpg" title="A building made with lots of shiny mirror surfaces on the outside." alt="" /><figcaption>Our cities are about to get shiny, baby. <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/917349">Source: PxHere.</a>.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Getting an international agreement for roof mirrors would probably not be easy.</p>
                    <h3 id="efficiency">⚡ Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>Let us estimate how much would roof mirrors affect the Earth’s temperature. Again, we divide the problem into simpler estimations: how much area of mirrors we can place on buildings <code>A(mirror)</code>, what percentage of the Earth surface we can cover <code>p(mirror)</code>, and how much would they affect the temperature of the planet <code>ΔT(mirror)</code>, where the capital delta <code>Δ</code> represents the difference.</p>
                    <h4 id="how-many-mirrors">🪞 How Many Mirrors</h4>
                    <p>Each person on Earth occupies perhaps 10 square meters of space. In cities it is much less (since we live in buildings); in villages it is likely bigger. But we also use offices and malls, community buildings and stadiums, museums and palaces; so this estimate is very likely on the low side; all in all we might use perhaps 100 m². How many square meters of roofs do we use? Let’s say it is equivalent to 100 square meters.</p>
                    <p>7 billion people will occupy 700 billion square meters. But what really interests us is the % of total surface. Converting to square kilometers:</p>
                    <pre><code>1 km² = 1000000 m²,
                    A(buildings) ≈ 700 × 10^9 m² × 1 km² / 10^6 m² = 700 000 km².</code></pre>
                    <p>Given that the Earth has <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/6c4d9b9a41b27707b6720720df7161d6/Physical_World.pdf">500 million km²</a> including the oceans, we have at our disposal well below 1% of the total surface of the planet.</p>
                    <pre><code>p(buildings) ≈  700 000 km² / 500 000 000 km² ≈ 0.14%.</code></pre>
                    <p>This doesn’t seem enough. We have to turn to other sources: perhaps consider all human-made structures. Add roads and other pavimented surfaces and we can perhaps push it a bit further.</p>
                    <pre><code>p(mirror) ≈ 0.2%.</code></pre>
                    <p>Let us check this estimate with independent data. According to NASA urban regions cover <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/urban_effects.html">0.2% of the Earth’s land surface</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.fao.org/uploads/media/glc-share-doc.pdf">Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN</a>, artificial surfaces cover 0.6% of the land surface. For the total surface we have to multiply by the proportion of land surface, or 150 / 500 million square km:</p>
                    <pre><code>p(artificial) ≈ 0.6% × A(land) / A(Earth) ≈ 0.6% × 150 / 500 ≈ 0.18%.</code></pre>
                    <p>Our prediction of 0.2% was not bad at all!</p>
                    <h4 id="expected-cooling">🥶 Expected Cooling</h4>
                    <p>How much would 0.2% of mirror surfaces affect our temperature? A very rough first estimate is based on this idea: apart from internal geothermal energy, the Earth gets most of its heat from the Sun, most of it from infrared light. To begin with let us say that we can reflect half the heat out to space. Our little project would reflect 0.1% of the heat.</p>
                    <p>To ease our task we will work in Kelvin degrees (or kelvins), which are degrees above absolute zero. This <a href="https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/9210/what-is-the-current-equilibrium-surface-temperature-of-earth-i-e-without-the-s">answer from StackExchange</a> calculates that the Earth’s temperature would drop to 35 K without our Sun. Right now it is around 300 K, so we can assume that the Earth gets around 300 K from the Sun, and it is linear: reducing sun heat by 1% would cool the Earth by 3 K (or 3 C). So knowing our proportion of mirrors from before:</p>
                    <pre><code>ΔT(mirror) = T(Earth) × p(mirror) ≈ 300 K × 0.2% = 0.6 K.</code></pre>
                    <p>If we reflect 0.2% of the heat we might decrease the temperature by around half a degree. Not a lot. So this little project is perhaps not worth the hassle, at least globally.</p>
                    <h3 id="side-effects">💊 Side Effects</h3>
                    <p>The nice part of this project is that infrared mirrors on roofs would help <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/mirror-on-roof-renovation">cool our buildings</a>, reducing the need for air conditioning. The same is true for <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160825152054.htm">windows</a> by the way. Whole cities might also be cooler this way. Even for cold countries this effect would be welcome in summer.</p>
                    <p>Can we do better? How about lining the Sahara with mirrors? What about other deserts? Maintenance would be horrible! But what we can do is install reflective roofs on crops that are sensitive to heat.</p>
                    <p>There have been recent trials of combining <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90861486/agrivoltaics-crops-under-solar-panels-good-for-panels">solar panels with agriculture farms</a>, with excellent results. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/growing-crops-under-solar-panels-now-theres-a-bright-idea/">Crop yields are improved</a> by the combination. We can also combine <a href="https://theconversation.com/can-mirrors-boost-solar-panel-output-and-help-overcome-trumps-tariffs-90663">solar panels with mirrors</a> which increase their efficiency, plus also reflect unused sunlight back to space. Combined with large agricultural areas they might cover vast expanses of land, not just the puny 0.18% of the surface of the planet that we could muster only with buildings. Imagine 5% of the land surface devoted to crops + solar power, reflecting any excess heat back to space.</p>
                    <p>Even if only 1/3 of the heat was radiated back for our <code>crops+solar</code> project:</p>
                    <pre><code>p(crops+solar) = 1/3 × 5% × A(land) / A(Earth) ≈ 1/3 × 5% × 150/500 ≈ 0.5%,</code></pre>
                    <pre><code>ΔT(crops+solar) = 1/3 × T(Earth) × p(crops+solar) ≈ 300 K × 0.5% = 1.5 K.</code></pre>
                    <p>Now 1.5 degrees are significant cooling. Our little mirror project could become a real game changer!</p>
