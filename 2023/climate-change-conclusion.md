## My Contribution

What do I intend to do?
For starters, stop paying attention to those "carbon capture" supposedly high-tech projects,
which I think are just lame attempts at fixing our problems with technology,
when better solutions are right there in front of us.
I may of course be wrong.

It is possible to fix our climate, but it will not be easy.
The problem is getting bigger every year,
so we really need to act now.
A concerted effort by every government in the planet will be necessary.
I sincerely hope that we spring to action before the situation is too severe.

I strongly believe that we should _immediately_:
* switch to low-carbon energy sources,
* start building nuclear power stations right away,
* electrify transport urgently and switch to low-emissions construction techniques,
* use the list of
[CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita)
as a hall of shame,
* raise sactions against the worst polluters.

In short, treat it as the worldwide emergency that it is now,
and as the impending catastrophe that we may have upon us in a few decades.

But first we need to convince everyone in the planet of the danger.
In this regard, the quick changes in climate that we are witnessing right now can be a mixed blessing,
as they are opening the eyes of many climate denialists.
Making everyone participate of the challenges involved in turning the tide
can perhaps help the general population to understand the huge efforts involved.
The reversal of so many decades of reckless carbonization will involve sacrifices for everyone on the planet;
probably changing our way of life, perhaps sacrifice some sacred cows.
We need to be ready.

## ü§î Conclusion

Climate change is upon us;
every year we are breaking temperature records,
and previously cool areas are becoming unbearable in summer.
Taking carbon out of the atmosphere will help alleviate the most severe effects.
We can start doing it right now,
with low tech projects such as planting trees everywhere.

We can also get creative,
like with mirror rooftop installations.

I have learned a lot speaking about these issues with many friends,
including Juan Villamizar y Juan Searle.
