In the [first part](/2023/contradiction-what-is) we have seen
how contradiction is not as easy to pinpoint as we would like.
So now we ask ourselves:
can we make a rock-solid definition of what a contradiction is in mathematics,
or at least in logic?
We will try here.

## ≢ Logic Contradiction?

We saw before that a contradiction in logic is simply:

> A contradiction means asserting that a statement and its contrary are true.

### Introduction to Logic

Cool, but what is [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic)?
It is a branch of philosophy
(or mathematics, depending on who you ask)
that studies the truth of statements,
without entering on what those statements actually mean.

We want to formalize logic to be able to speak about it in symbols:
for instance, if we have a statement `A`
(whatever `A` may mean),
we will speak about whether `A` is true.
`A` can mean "my dog is beautiful" or "Petra speaks about stained glass";
we don't care much.

There is a beautiful symbol `¬` which means "not" in logic.
So to negate `A` we will say `¬A`, which means the opposite of `A`.
So if `A` is "my dog is beautiful", `¬A` means "my dog is **not** beautiful",
which will make me very angry if I like my dog.
But at this level we are pure logicians and we don't care about meaning.

We can combine it with the symbol `∧`, which means "and",
we can write a contradiction as:

```
A ∧ ¬A
```

which just means that both `A` and `¬A` are true.
There we have it!

### 🙉 Meaning of Logic

At this point you may be thinking:

> I can easily think of a sentence that can be true at the same time as its opposite.

Let's see:
what if `A` is simply "It may rain"?
Then we can say very reasonably say:

> "It may rain and it may not rain."

### 🙅 Back to Contradiction

At the beginning of the 20th century many clever people were thinking about

## 🤔 Conclusion

Do I want to conclude,
as many laypeople say,
that logic and mathematics are useless,
since they incur in contradictions?
Not at all;
I think that,
with all their faults,
logic and mathematics can help us think more efficiently.
Being able to identify contradiction is a very helpful skill,
even if sometimes we have to accept it.

I have to thank my brother Fernando for teaching me about simple logic paradoxes
as a kid.
