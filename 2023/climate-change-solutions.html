                    <p>The world is overheating. This is not opinion, this is a fact that can be measured by satellites. But you don‚Äôt need high tech: in fact it can be verified by any people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record">thermometers and old notebooks</a>.</p>
                    <h1 id="is-it-real">üå°Ô∏è Is It Real?</h1>
                    <p>What can we do about it, and should we do anything? First we would have to agree on the causes, and as you may know there is a huge debate in our polarized society. Not in scientific circles though. Some 35 years ago I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligent_Man%27s_Guide_to_Science">Asimov‚Äôs Guide to Science</a> by the great Isaac Asimov, probably the 1972 or 1984 Spanish editions. When describing the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere he had these words:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation rather strongly. This means that when there are appreciable amounts of it in the atmosphere, it tends to block the escape of heat at night from the sun-warmed earth. The result is that heat accumulates. On the other hand, when the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere falls, the earth steadily cools.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>If the current concentration of carbon dioxide in the air should double (from 0.03 per cent of the air to 0.06 per cent) that small change would suffice to raise the earth‚Äôs over-all temperature by three degrees and would bring about the complete and quick melting of the continental glaciers. If the carbon dioxide dropped to half the present amount, the temperature would drop sufficiently to bring the glaciers down to New York City again.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>Whatever the cause of the ice ages may have been, it seems now that man himself may be changing the climate in store for the future. The American physicist Gilbert N. Plass has suggested that we may be seeing the last of the ice ages, because the furnaces of civilization are loading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. A hundred million chimneys are ceaselessly pouring carbon dioxide into the air; the total amount is about six billion tons a year 200 times the quantity coming from volcanoes. Plass pointed out that since 1900 the carbon dioxide content of our atmosphere has increased about 10 per cent. This addition to the earth‚Äôs ‚Äúgreenhouse‚Äù shield against the escape of heat, he calculated, should raise the average temperature by about 1.1 degrees C. per century. During the first half of the twentieth century the average temperature has indeed risen at this rate [‚Ä¶]</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I am quoting from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/intelligentmansg0000unse/page/120/mode/2up">1960 edition</a>, so human-caused global warming is not a new theory invented by George Soros; it is just a trivial extrapolation. If we look at the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as measured in the Mauna Loa observatory, far from all sources of industrial contamination, the trend could not be more worrying.</p>
                    <figure>
                    <img src="pics/climate-change-dioxide.gif" title="Data from the Mauna Loa Observatory: concentration in parts per million was ~310 in 1960, ~340 in 1985 and ~380 in 2010." alt="" /><figcaption>Atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ has been rising steadily since before 1960; the rate is accelerating. <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/obop/mlo/programs/esrl/co2/co2.html">Source</a>.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>It is highly likely that lowering CO‚ÇÇ would help alleviate global warming and other effects of climate change. So let us see if we humans can do something about it using some engineering and a great deal of ingenuity.</p>
                    <h1 id="some-solutions">üßë‚Äçüî¨ Some Solutions</h1>
                    <p>Right now there is no single solution to climate change, and probably we will have to use many of them if we are to survive our own trap.</p>
                    <p>Now, before we start, let‚Äôs be clear. The first measure to mitigate climate change should be to <strong>stop burning stuff</strong>; until we do, everything we do to mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will be made more difficult by the incoming gasses. But even if we stopped tomorrow and switched to 100% green energy (a mix of solar, wind, hydro and nuclear) there‚Äôs the little matter of what we do with all the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>We will review some solutions that can be found in the literature, and even some that anyone can think of, ranking them from more pedestrian to wildly out there. We will try to understand how much they help, and also if they have any side effects.</p>
                    <h2 id="fermi-estimation">üéöÔ∏è Fermi Estimation</h2>
                    <p>To gauge the impact of each solution we will use a method attributed to Enrico Fermi: <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/">Fermi estimation</a>. The great physicist said that he could estimate any physical problem in a napkin by a factor of one order of magnitude, that is: his answer would not be exact but should be between 10 times and one tenth of the correct solution. It is legendary his measurement of the energy of the first atomic bomb by dropping pieces of paper as it detonated and measuring their displacement in the air.</p>
                    <p>The method as we will apply it is simply to take an approximate estimation for each value, within an order of magnitude (between 10 times and 1/10th), and combine them in simple ways (basically addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). The solution will tend to the real value as long as errors are more or less distributed uniformly, i.e.¬†sometimes we are above, some times we are below.</p>
                    <p>We will try to do the same with the ideas below to see if they would help. We don‚Äôt need complicated climate models to get a rough idea of each method; even if we are off by 100% we will know if our solution should more or less work. Of course, we should go with the complicated models before investing real money in the idea. Plus, this process of estimation is a big part of the fun!</p>
                    <p>So let‚Äôs begin.</p>
                    <h2 id="lots-of-trees">üå≤ Lots of Trees</h2>
                    <p>The first solution can be a bit disappointing: planting lots of trees. I am sure you were looking for clever carbon-capture devices that could turn the tide and suck all that carbon out of the skies, using modern technology. Problem is, none of it works properly.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Mother Nature has created these wonderful machines, that have adapted during millions of years to do basically one thing: convert CO‚ÇÇ to carbon in their trunks. In the process they also generate sugars, create seeds and deter hungry animals, but these are secondary interests.</p>
                    <p>Another very interesting possibility is using algae, which are more efficient because they already have all the water necessary in their surroundings. These techniques are very likely more difficult to implement than just planting trees, and can have other side effects.</p>
                    <p>Just how many trees can we realistically plant in the world? Many areas are already covered in forests; others are deserts. Of the remaining areas, many are used for growing food; there are also cities and roads. We can of course plant trees in many of these places: as hedges of fields, in our streets, even as vertical gardens in buildings.</p>
                    <p>Some studies (e.g. <a href="">this one</a>) say that a trillion (10^12) trees are feasible.</p>
                    <p>The publications <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/17/world/trillion-trees-climate-change-intl-scn/index.html">CNN</a>. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/forests-climate-change-co2-greenhouse-gases-trillion-trees-global-warming-a8782071.html">decade</a> when in reality it could wipe out all the excess carbon. I suspect that the difference stems from the confusion between tons of CO2 and tons of carbon.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://trilliontrees.org/">Trillion trees</a>. <a href="https://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/trillion-trees/">Trillion trees</a>. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/one-trillion-trees-world-economic-forum-launches-plan-to-help-nature-and-the-climate/">World Economic Forum</a>.</p>
                    <h3 id="efficiency">‚ö° Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>We will divide the problem into three: total excess carbon in the atmosphere <code>T(C)</code>, mass of carbon per tree <code>m(C)</code>, and number of trees <code>n(trees)</code>. Our problem will be solved when:</p>
                    <pre><code>T(C) = m(C) √ó n(trees),</code></pre>
                    <p>or:</p>
                    <pre><code>n(trees) = T(C) / m(C).</code></pre>
                    <h4 id="total-excess-carbon">üõ¢Ô∏è Total Excess Carbon</h4>
                    <p>First let‚Äôs estimate the total amount of excess carbon in the atmosphere. If we look at the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276629/global-co2-emissions/">data from Statista</a>, there is a more or less steady linear increase from about 1943 to 2021. (Yes, emissions are still increasing.) Latest numbers are 37 billion metric tons of CO‚ÇÇ. Say we have a completely linear graph from 1940 to 2020 (80 years), the total of carbon emissions would be something like the number of years multiplied by the midpoint:</p>
                    <pre><code>T ‚âà 80 √ó 40 / 2 GtCO‚ÇÇ ‚âà 1600 GtCO‚ÇÇ.</code></pre>
                    <p>Remember, for now we don‚Äôt have to get an exact number, just a rough estimation, so we can round our numbers to make them easier to deal with. Let‚Äôs convert to the international system, remembering that the prefix <em>giga</em> means 10^9 and a ton is just a million grams:</p>
                    <pre><code>T(CO‚ÇÇ) ‚âà 1.6 √ó 1000 √ó 10^9 √ó 10^6 g ‚âà 1.6 √ó 10^18 g.</code></pre>
                    <p>How much carbon is that exactly? A molecule of CO‚ÇÇ has one atom of carbon (C) with atomic weight 12 and two O‚Äôs each with atomic 16; the total portion of carbon is thus 12/(12+16+16) ‚âà 27%:</p>
                    <pre><code>T(C) ‚âà 0.27 √ó 1.6 √ó 10^18 g ‚âà 0.4 √ó 10^18 g.</code></pre>
                    <p>So a little bit under half a million million million grams. Some part of that has by now been absorbed by the oceans and other natural processes, but most of it remains there. Good! We are getting there.</p>
                    <h4 id="carbon-per-tree">üíé Carbon per Tree</h4>
                    <p>Now let‚Äôs estimate how much carbon can we store in a tree. Let‚Äôs assume an average 4 meter tall tree, with a trunk radius of 25 cm; this gives us a volume of:</p>
                    <pre><code>V ‚âà œÄ √ó 0.25 √ó 0.25 √ó 4 m¬≥ ‚âà 0.75 m¬≥.</code></pre>
                    <p>Wood has a density similar to water (some woods float, others don‚Äôt), which is 1 kg per liter (a cube with sides of 10 cm), so our average tree trunk will weigh:</p>
                    <pre><code>m(tree) = d √ó V ‚âà 1 kg / 0.001 m¬≥ √ó 0.75 m¬≥ ‚âà 750 kg.</code></pre>
                    <p>But the tree also has branches and leaves and roots; we can estimate that the trunk is just half the total weight, which is probably <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Proportion-of-the-tree-biomass-from-the-trunk-the-branch-the-leaf-and-the-root-in_fig12_299376027">not that far off</a>.</p>
                    <p>Therefore we will have twice as much mass in the whole tree. But only around <a href="https://web.extension.illinois.edu/askextension/thisQuestion.cfm?ThreadID=19549&amp;catID=192&amp;AskSiteID=87">half of the tree</a> will be carbon, so we will stick to 750 kg of carbon per tree, or a bit under a million grams:</p>
                    <pre><code>m(C) ‚âà 0.75 √ó 10^6 g.</code></pre>
                    <h4 id="number-of-trees">üå≥ Number of Trees</h4>
                    <p>Finally, can we plant enough trees?</p>
                    <p>As we saw at the beginning, to remove all excess carbon from the atmosphere we need a grand total of:</p>
                    <pre><code>n(trees) = T(C) / m(C) ‚âà 0.4 √ó 10^18 g / 0.75 √ó 10^6 g ‚âà 0.5 √ó 10^12.</code></pre>
                    <p>Or around half a trillion trees. Is this possible at all?</p>
                    <p>Many studies have looked at this question. We will just do our own Fermi estimation.</p>
                    <p>Let‚Äôs take first Spain as an example. With a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">total area</a> of roughly half a million square kilometers it has a good forest cover of around 30%; another 30% is arable lands; the rest is mountains, cities, roads and arid lands.</p>
                    <p>Let us suppose we can cover this 30% with trees every 10 meters. (A bit dense but not uncommon.) A grid of trees spaced 10 meters would yield 100 √ó 100 = 10000 trees per square kilometer. The total for Spain would be:</p>
                    <pre><code>n(Spain) = 30% √ó A(Spain) √ó n(km¬≤) ‚âà 30% √ó 500000 √ó 10000 ‚âà 1.5 √ó 10^9.</code></pre>
                    <p>So a little over a billion trees. The world has around <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/6c4d9b9a41b27707b6720720df7161d6/Physical_World.pdf">150 million km¬≤</a> of land area; if we can replicate our reforestation project in the whole world we would get:</p>
                    <pre><code>n(world) = 30% √ó A(world) √ó n(km¬≤) ‚âà 30% √ó 150 √ó 10^6 √ó 10^4 ‚âà 0.45 √ó 10^12.</code></pre>
                    <p>Almost exactly our half a trillion trees! So very roughly our project should be feasible.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions">Project Drawdown</a> has a number of projects related to forests, <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/tree-plantations-on-degraded-land">tree plantations</a> accounting for 22 gigatons of CO2.</p>
                    <h3 id="side-effects">Side Effects</h3>
                    <p>The side effects of planting a lot of trees are generally very nice: having a lot of trees. They cool the surroundings, help fixate the ground and provide a living environment for other creatures. In cities they lower the temperature of a street by at least five degrees in summer.</p>
                    <p>There‚Äôs the matter of albedo (or proportion of sunlight reflected): trees are generally darker than rock, and therefore can negate some of the benefits of carbon capture by absorbing heat. But this is a</p>
                    <p>Also, what do we do with all that carbon once it is stored in trees? If we just leave them there then there is a limit to the carbon taken from the atmosphere. This solution might be potentially even more efficient if we somehow mowed down trees from time to time and disposed of them, for example by burying them or throwing them into the sea.</p>
                    <h2 id="all-nuclear-power">All Nuclear Power</h2>
                    <p>Lowly ranked by <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/nuclear-power">Project Drawdown</a>, with only 3 billion tons removed.</p>
                    <h2 id="mirror-roofs">ü™©ü™û Mirror Roofs</h2>
                    <p>Our second solution involves a little bit of creativity. Since the Earth is heated mainly by the Sun, why not divert some of that heat back to space?</p>
                    <h3 id="efficiency-1">‚ö° Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>Let us estimate how much would roof mirrors affect the Earth‚Äôs temperature. Again, we divide the problem into simpler estimations: how much mirrors we can place on buildings, and how much they would affect the temperature.</p>
                    <h4 id="how-many-mirrors">ü™û How Many Mirrors</h4>
                    <p>Each person on Earth occupies perhaps 100 square meters of space. In cities it is much less (since we live in buildings); in a village it is likely bigger. But we also use offices and malls, so this estimate is likely small.</p>
                    <p>7 billion people will occupy 700 billion square meters, or 700 000 km2. Given that the Earth has 500 million km2,</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/static/6c4d9b9a41b27707b6720720df7161d6/Physical_World.pdf">150 million km¬≤</a></p>
                    <p>Urban regions cover <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/urban_effects.html">0.2% of the Earth‚Äôs land surface</a>. Artificial surfaces <a href="http://www.curiousmeerkat.co.uk/questions/much-land-earth-inhabited/">0.6% of the land surface</a>. Road: 0.15%.</p>
                    <p>So in total (0.6+0.15)/3 ~ 0.3%.</p>
                    <h4 id="expected-cooling">ü•∂ Expected Cooling</h4>
                    <p>How much would 1% of mirrors affect our temperature? A very rough first estimate is based on this idea: the Earth gets most of its heat from the Sun, apart from internal geothermal energy.</p>
                    <p>To ease our task we will work in Kelvin degrees (or kelvins), which are degrees above absolute zero. This <a href="https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/9210/what-is-the-current-equilibrium-surface-temperature-of-earth-i-e-without-the-s">answer from StackExchange</a> calculates that the Earth‚Äôs temperature would drop to 35 K without our Sun. Right now it is around 300 K. We can assume that the Earth gets around 300 K from the Sun, and it is linear: reducing sunlight by 1% would cool the Earth by 3 K (or 3 C).</p>
                    <p>Since current consensus is between 2 and 3 C by 2050, this silly project would reduce temperatures to before the industrial age.</p>
