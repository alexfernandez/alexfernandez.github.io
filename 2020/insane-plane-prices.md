If you have ever travelled by plane you have probably suffered some form of insane pricing scheme:
cheaper tickets if you fly with several stopovers,
different prices depending on where and how you buy your ticket,
crazy price hikes if the flight is close in time,
and in general a Kafkaesque world that induces more nausea than a windy landing.
Why is this? And how can it be avoided?

In this article I will review why and how does the industry get away with this,
and make a humble (+ a bold) proposal.
It is written from a subjective perspective and therefore I will not add careful references.
But I would love it if we would take collective action and improve the situation for future generations.

## So What is the Problem, Dear?

Simple.
Go to your favorite airline website and check the price of a plane ticket for any destination and time frame.
Then go back the next day and do the same again: chances are prices will have fluctuated.
Do the same for a few times for the sake of it,
and you will have a nice curve that has nothing whatsoever to do with actual value
or any other aspect of the real world.

### Previous Visits

But there is more, oh so much more.
If you visit the same place twice with the same browser in the same day
you will receive a second, different price which will probably be higher.
The airline wants you to think that tickets are in high demand,
and make you buy in a surge of adrenaline and cold sweat.

For some time this annoying behaviour could be thwarted with private browsing modes.
But then web servers got smarter and started to detect users with browser fingerprinting.
After a while they would even check when the source IP address was the same,
and try to overcharge with their artificial demand trick.

### Some History

At some point in the past airlines stopped charging a fixed price for plane seats;
instead they implemented weird price fixing schemes that charge everyone on the plane a different amount,
depending on what seat it is, at what time the ticket was purchased,
the intermediary selling the ticket,
and stupid things like how often they visited the website (!).
Such practices are completely opaque and unfair to buyers.

According to the Wikipedia article on
[Dynamic pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing#Dynamic_pricing_in_air_transportation)
this happened sometime in the 1980s in the US,
and I have to assume that it was imported to Europe in the 1990s.

During the 2000s this madness was fully implemented everywhere,
making airlines some of the least loved organizations in the world,
right behind criminal syndicates but perhaps a bit ahead of tobacco purveyors.
They were so obviously trying to squeeze customers dry,
and for some reason we customers tend to not like that.

Around this time low cost airlines would start to announce flights
"starting at €1/$1/£1".
For some reason

### Arms Race

At some point during the early 2000s flight comparison sites started to appear,
skipping all those protections and allowing users to really compare flight prices.

### Last Minute

Last minute tickets are quite contradictory in nature.
Plane tickets have a fixed expiry date: when boarding is closed off.
At that point they will lose all their value.

Whenever the flight time is approaching prices should therefore drop.
This is the foundation of sites like lastminute.com
that offered cheap ticket prices close to the flight.

But then there are people with emergencies that just have to travel.
Airlines will probably speak of a sudden business oportunity when they want to whiten this practice.
But there are also personal tragedies like health crises or the death of a loved one
which force people to travel as soon as humanly possible.
Surge pricing when the flight nears often means making money off bereaved people:
airlines behave like vultures with total impunity.

## Bizarrities and Excentrologies

There are some phenomena that just defy what little common sense we may have left.

### Stopovers

At some point airlines just seem to want to screw you,
burning the planet in the process.
If you go to your favorite plane comparison site and look for any flight
it is quite likely that the cheapest ticket is not a direct route;
instead it has one or sometimes even two stopovers,
lenghtening flight time considerably.

Now I like to think of myself as a reasonable person,
but there is no way you will ever convince me that flying from Madrid to Palma
and then to Vienna can be made cheaper than going straight to Vienna.
The only explanation I can think of is that airlines are charging a premium for flying comfortably,
or equivalently they are discounting the annoyances of having to change planes and spend all day travelling.
We might also think that those two flights are less in demand than the straight route,
but something tells me that if I wanted to fly from Palma to Vienna I would be offered
Palma → Madrid → Vienna as a cheaper option.

![Madrid → Vienna cheapest options. I promise this was my first search.](pics/insane-madrid-vienna.png "Madrid → Vienna 2020-02-04 to 2020-02-07, first option is Madrid → Palma → Vienna at $67 and second also has return Vienna → Cologne → Madrid at $80")

### Unused Return Tickets

When I started working on European projects in 2001 I had to travel frequently.
Our department secretary would book the planes for us at a travel agency.
She was kind of a wizard at finding cheap options in combination with the agency.

Now, airlines at the time wanted to rip off business travellers such as ourselves
even harder than regular customers.
Plane tickets during the week were much more expensive than when one of the trips happened on a weekend.
Sometimes they would propose a cheaper alternative:
instead of e.g. Madrid → Cologne on Monday with return ticket Cologne → Madrid on Thursday,
they would buy Madrid → Cologne on Monday with a fake return ticket on Sunday,
and then buy Cologne → Madrid on Thursday again with a fake return ticket on Sunday.
We would of course only use the first leg of the first ticket +
the second leg of the second ticket.
Messy, huh?

But that is not all.
Quite often direct flights would be too expensive and we would be routed through some big hub like Frankfurt.
so we would need to book Madrid → Frankfurt and Frankfurt → Cologne (and back).
And quite often the same restrictions would apply to tickets during the week to all four tickets.
Therefore we would be travelling with **eight plane tickets** of which we would only use four:

* Madrid → Frankfurt,
* Frankfurt → Madrid (fake, on the next weekend),
* Frankfurt → Cologne,
* Cologne → Frankfurt (fake, on the next weekend),
* Cologne → Frankfurt (for real now),
* Frankfurt → Cologne (fake, on the next weekend),
* Frankfurt → Madrid (finally),
* and Madrid → Frankfurt (again fake on the next weekend).

Somehow all this mess was cheaper than buying regular Madrid → Cologne tickets.

Luckily at some point airlines stopped this madness.

### Changes and Cancellations

Another source of annoyances that would make old Franz Kafka proud
is the issue of flight modifications.
In the good old days you would go to the airport some hours or even days earlier,
ask on the company counter, and change your flight to an earlier one,
perhaps paying a nominal fee but often for free.

The other day I

### Fixed Pricing

One of the great improvements in commerce is **the price tag**:
the price of an item displayed next to it.
This allowed buyers to stop bargaining for every purchase,
saving countless hours of time both for the buyer and for the seller.
If you have gone shopping in a country where prices are not fixed
you know the nightmare of wasting time haggling when everyone already has an idea of how much things should cost.
Or even worse, the regrets of overpaying because you are in a hurry or just not in the mood.

Fixed pricing solved all of this and allowed commerce to blossom,
with inventions like the supermarket or the mall flourishing.

## Conclusions

The situation stinks,
but it is not unsolvable.
International regulation would probably be required to fix the situation completely.
Meanwhile countries can start fixing the issue for national flights.
