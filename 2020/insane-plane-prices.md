If you have ever travelled by plane you have probably suffered some form of insane pricing scheme:
cheaper tickets if you fly with several stopovers,
crazy prices if the flight is close in time,
and so on.
Why is this? And how can it be avoided?

In this article I will review why and how does the industry get away with this,
and make a humble proposal.

## Pricing Software



## Conclusions

The situation stinks,
but it is not unsolvable.
International regulation would probably be required to fix the situation completely.
Meanwhile countries can start fixing the issue for national flights.
