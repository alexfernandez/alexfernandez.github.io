If you have ever travelled by plane you have probably suffered some form of insane pricing scheme:
cheaper tickets if you fly with several stopovers,
crazy prices if the flight is close in time,
and so on.
Why is this? And how can it be avoided?

In this article I will review why and how does the industry get away with this,
and make a humble proposal.
It is written from a subjective perspective and therefore I will not add careful references.

## So What is the Problem, Dear?

Simple.
Go to your favorite airline website and check the price of a plane ticket for any destination and time frame.
Then go back the next day and do the same again: chances are prices will have fluctuated.
Do the same for a few times.

### History

At some point in the past airlines stopped charging a fixed price for plane seats,
and instead implemented weird price fixing schemes that charge everyone on the plane a different amount,
depending on what seat it is, at what time the ticket was purchased,
the intermediary selling the ticket,
and stupid things like how often they visited the website (!).
Such practices are completely opaque and unfair to buyers.

According to the Wikipedia article on
[Dynamic pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing#Dynamic_pricing_in_air_transportation)
this happened sometime in the 80s in the US,
and I have to assume that it was imported to Europe in the 90s.

### Last Minute

Last minute tickets are quite contradictory in nature.
Plane tickets have a fixed expiry date: when boarding is closed off.
At that point they will lose all their value.

Whenever the flight time is approaching prices should therefore drop.
This is the foundation of sites like lastminute.com
that offered cheap ticket prices close to the flight.

But then there are people with emergencies that just have to travel.
Airlines will probably speak of a sudden business oportunity when they want to whiten this practice.
But there are also personal tragedies like health crises or the death of a loved one
which force people to travel as soon as humanly possible.
Surge pricing when the flight nears often means making money off bereaved people:
airlines behave like vultures with total impunity.

## Bizarrities and Excentricologies

There are some phenomenons that just blow my mind.

### Stopovers

At some point airlines just seem to want to screw you,
burning the planet in the process.
If you go to your favorite plane comparison site and look for any flight
it is quite likely that the cheapest ticket is not a direct route;
instead it has one or sometimes even two stopovers,
lenghtening flight time considerably.

Now I like to think of myself as a reasonable person,
but there is no way you will ever convince me that flying from Madrid to Palma
and then to Vienna can be made cheaper than going straight to Vienna.
The only explanation I can think of is that airlines are charging a premium for flying comfortably,
or equivalently they are discounting the annoyances of having to change planes and spend all day travelling.
We might also think that those two flights are less in demand than the straight route,
but something tells me that if I wanted to fly from Palma to Vienna I would be offered
Palma → Madrid → Vienna as a cheaper option.

![Madrid → Vienna cheapest options. I promise this was my first search.](pics/insane-madrid-vienna.png "Madrid → Vienna 2020-02-04 to 2020-02-07, first option is Madrid → Palma → Vienna at $67 and second also has return Vienna → Cologne → Madrid at $80")

### Unused Return Tickets

When I started working on European projects in 2001 I had to travel frequently.
Our department secretary would book the planes for us,
and she was kind of a wizard at finding cheap options at our travel agency.
Sometimes she would propose a cheaper alternative than flying round-trip:
buy a set of return tickets

### Overbooking

## A Modest Proposal

### Fixed Pricing

One of the great improvements in commerce is **the price tag**:
the price of an item displayed next to it.
This allowed buyers to stop bargaining for every purchase,
saving countless hours of time both for the buyer and for the seller.
If you have gone shopping in a country where prices are not fixed
you know the nightmare of wasting time haggling when everyone already has an idea of how much things should cost.
Or even worse, the regrets of overpaying because you are in a hurry or just not in the mood.

Fixed pricing solved all of this and allowed commerce to blossom,
with inventions like the supermarket or the mall flourishing.

## Pricing Software



## Conclusions

The situation stinks,
but it is not unsolvable.
International regulation would probably be required to fix the situation completely.
Meanwhile countries can start fixing the issue for national flights.
