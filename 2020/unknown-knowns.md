In this article we will examine the subject of
_unknown knowns_,
and how they affect any project related to software development.
Spoiler: much more than we would thinks!

## The Rumsfeld Quadrant

Donald Rumsfeld was not a nice person.
In 2002 and 2003 he was a stark proponent of the disastrous invasion of Iraq,
[insisting on the existence of weapons of mass destruction](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/truth/why/said.html):

> We know where [the weapons of mass destruction] are.
> They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat.

-- This Week with George Stephanopolous, March 30, 2003

He was also responsible for the
[torture of prisoners in Abu Ghraib](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/04/politics/rumsfeld-says-he-offered-to-quit.html).

But he gave the world at least
[one great quote](https://web.archive.org/web/20200420092124/http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636):

> [...] there are known knowns; there are things we know we know.
> We also know there are known unknowns;
that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.
But there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't know.

## Conclusions

After learning about the effect of
_unknown unknowns_
in software development,
it is very important to think about
_unknown knowns_.
