Last year I published an article about [perpetual flying machines](https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna):
flying machines that could stay aloft indefinitely.
The initial numbers were intriguing: the concept was viable.
But nobody has done it yet.
Should we accept the challenge?

# 🏗️ Building Models

The engineering challenge is thus possible.

## 📏 Model Scale

What would be an appropriate scale for a model?
In the [last article](https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna)
I used a reference design 10 meters long and 5 meters wide.
That is definitely too large for an initial model.
Also, the proportions have changed since then.

### 🏉 Proportions

The previous design was akin to a boat:
square and flat profile.
I have since come to appreciate a more classic dirigible design,
in the shape of a spheroid.
