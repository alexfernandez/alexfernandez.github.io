										<h1>🔧 On Tooling</h1>
										<p>🧑‍💻 With a Focus on Software Engineering<p>
									</header>
																				<p>During my bumpy career as CTO and manager (2019 ~ 2023) I have often
struggled to make the case for better developer tooling. For me it was a
no-brainer: paying developers a good chunk of money to do the same
change 10 times over in different places, or to wait for automated tests
to finish, seems like a huge waste.</p>

<p>I have focused on improving internal tooling whenever I had the
chance, even devoting some people full time to the task. But I have
often failed to show the value of this investment to (other) company
founders: having devs not work on features is what they really found
wasteful. After all, product features are seen as value; while internal
tooling is at best a necessary evil.</p>
<p>For now I will offer a couple of data points in favor of my position.
Some big tech companies (Google and Meta come to mind) have the best
internal tooling, period; this is in large part what enables them to be
ahead of the competition. And Joel Spolsky, creator of StackOverflow and
Trello, features tooling in several of the points of his legendary <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">Joel
Test</a>, used to evaluate the quality of a software team. Specifically
point 9 in the list says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me make the argument now in long form, so hopefully we will all
enjoy the benefits of better tooling.</p>
<h1 id="the-value-of-tools">💰 The Value of Tools</h1>
<p>In many professional areas there are almost religious wars about
tooling. This is even more pronounced in software development, where the
arguments between e.g. proponents of the vim and Emacs text editors have
been raging on for years. And they are probably more than justified.</p>
<p>Our starting point is that the value of the work performed by a
professional is augmented by the tools they use. A farmer that has to
pick potatoes one by one will be 10 times more productive when they use
a potato collector, and again 10 times more when collection is done with
a tractor. The value of their work goes up accordingly.</p>
<p>This is, simply put, why the industrial revolution raised the living
standards of people. When an employee manufactures 10 times more screws
the employer has the potential to pay more, and then this person can go
out and spend that money in more valuable goods. It is true that
employers tend to want to keep money for themselves as profit. But the
knowledge required to operate complex machinery also grows, which is a
barrier of entry for other potential employees; this encourages better
salaries for skilled operators.</p>
<h2 id="compound-value">Compound Value</h2>
<p>The second derivative is that more productive employers have more
money to invest in factory tooling, which in turn improves
productivity.. As time goes by the quality of tools goes up, and this
enables the next cycle of investments. With better tools tolerances and
clearances will go down, which means that the machines built can be more
useful. Precision engineering has allowed us to have millimeter-thick
screws and supersonic airplanes and computers. The value of good tools
thus compounds over time.</p>
<p>Oh, let me tell you about general purpose computers. In a sense they
are the ultimate productivity tools: they can run random programs to do
any tasks and can also be augmented with custom software. Computers can
also drive lots of different hardware, from weather sensors to
industrial printers.</p>
<p>Properly coded programs can indeed control entire production lines.
Now we are not only speaking about increasing productivity for one
worker, but optimizing entire factories.</p>
<h2 id="exponential-value">🏒 Exponential Value</h2>
<p>Can this process of increasing value accelerate even more? Have we
found the <em>perpetuum mobile</em> of productivity? Well, up to a
point.</p>
<p>Compound interest leads to exponential savings. We have to assume
that there is some limit somewhere: at some point we cannot optimize a
process any longer. The old dream of a single person running a fully
automated factory is still not possible, and production is just a single
aspect of a company. But when we move to the software industry this
limit is even further away. Companies like Google and Amazon showed us
that one sysadmin could first herd a bunch of servers, then a rack and
at some point a whole datacenter.</p>
<p>In my mind, the whole point of software startups, hockey-stick
exponential curves and hypergrowth is precisely that we are building
better tools – for other people or for ourselves. Sometimes for both, as
we will see below when we speak about dog-fooding. Uber is in a sense
just a productivity tool that matches drivers with riders more
efficiently; everything else is financial wizardry to collect the
benefits.</p>
<p>Once you are into this frame of mind you will see tools everywhere.
For productivity, financial improvement, for better living or just for
entertainment; any <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies">list
of unicorns</a> is just a catalog of efficient tools. Google transformed
a few categories when they offered better tools for search, email and
targeted ads; Apple is the ultimate hardware toolmaker. And so on.</p>
<h1 id="taking-care-of-tooling">💰 Taking Care of Tooling</h1>
<p>Let us now focus on internal tooling: after all it’s what makes us
productive to build the next generation of tools. If your tools are the
same as or worse than what your competition is using, how do you expect
to do better than them?</p>
<h2 id="good-professionals">Good Professionals</h2>
<p>Some people tend to think that good professionals do their best even
with crappy tools. Sure, just like in the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kl0UBS4ZaM">awesome scene</a>
from the movie <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(2013_film)">Rush (2013)</a>,
Niki Lauda can run really fast in a Lancia Flavia 2000; but he will not
be winning any F1 championships any time soon in that tin can.</p>
<p>Would you ask a good butcher to slice a lamb leg with a butter knife?
Just as well you might ask a developer to write a web application in a
very low-level programming language, like assembler. In my experience
good professionals can recognize and make good use of the best tools;
and they take care of their tooling.</p>
<p>Good tools are not enough though; you need good professionals to make
the best use of them.</p>
<h2 id="building-tools">🦾 Building Tools</h2>
<p>Now if we look at great professionals, they are able not just to pick
great tools and take care of them; they can also build their own
tools.</p>
<p>Knowing <a href="https://pinchito.es/2016/build-or-not">when to
build</a> is an excellent skill. Also knowing what to build is
important: <a href="https://pinchito.es/2022/building-bridges">building
bridges</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tools-that-improve-themselves">Tools that Improve
Themselves</h2>
<p>The ultimate tool that we have is language. As I have <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2017/origins-language">speculated
elsewhere</a> it must have developed slowly at first as we evolved, and
then exploded in a myriad of words.</p>
<p>But not everyone uses language the same way. In particular,
philosophy and grammar <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind">were born hand in
hand</a>. Grammar is, simply put, language turning on itself: you can
speak about language. As the great García Calvo used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language is the only tool that operates on itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And consequently we can use language to improve how we speak. This is
a turning point in our development as tool makers. Great wordsmiths like
Shakespeare have innovated in language: the Immortal Bard <a
href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-words/">created
or introduced 1700 words</a> for the English language. While J R R
Tolkien created <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_constructed_by_Tolkien">no
less than 15 languages</a> for his fictitious Middle Earth.</p>
<h2 id="code-as-tooling">Code as Tooling</h2>
<p>As my friend Luis Medel so carefully explains in his excellent
Spanish article <a
href="https://luismedel.com/palabras/la-martingala-del-software/">“La
martingala del software”</a>, software is a tool in itself. And just as
any language, it is a tool that can operate on itself.</p>
<p>There are many code-specific tools: compilers, code checkers (or
linters), continuous integration. One of the great tools is <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2012/continuous-deployment">continuous
deployment</a>: it allows devs to deploy code to production with every
change, many times per day. It definitely changes the relationship with
code: it is seen as.</p>
<h2 id="other-dev-tools">Other Dev Tools</h2>
<p>There are many other crucial tools that ensure our success as
devs.</p>
<h2 id="dog-fooding">Dog Fooding</h2>
<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<p>Tooling is the ultimate investment for a company. If you want to
differentiate yourself from the competition start with having better
tools.</p>
