																				<p>During my bumpy career as CTO and manager I have often struggled to
make the case for better developer tooling. For me it was a no-brainer:
paying developers a good chunk of money to do the same change 10 times
over in different places, or to wait for automated tests to finish,
seems like a huge waste.</p>

<p>Some big tech companies (Google and Meta come to mind) have the best
internal tooling, period; this is in large part what enables them to be
ahead of the competition. And Joel Spolsky, creator of StackOverflow and
Trello, features tooling in several of the points of his legendary <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">Joel
Test</a>, used to evaluate the quality of a software team. Specifically
point 9 in the list says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have focused on improving internal tooling whenever I had the
chance, even devoting some people full time to the task. But I have
often failed to show the value of this investment to (other) company
founders: having devs not work on features is what they really found
wasteful. After all, product features are seen as value; while internal
tooling is at best a necessary evil.</p>
<h1 id="the-value-of-tools">üí∞ The Value of Tools</h1>
<p>In many professional areas there are almost religious wars about
tooling. This is even more pronounced in software development, where the
arguments between e.g.¬†proponents of the vim and Emacs text editors have
been raging on for years. And they are probably more than justified.</p>
<p>Our starting point is that the value of the work performed by a
professional is augmented by the tools they use. A farmer that has to
pick potatoes one by one will be 10 times more productive when they use
a potato collector, and again 10 times more when done with a tractor.
The value of their work goes up accordingly.</p>
<p>This is, simply put, why the industrial revolution raised the living
standards of people. When an employee manufactures 10 times more screws
the employer has the potential to pay more, and then this person can go
out and spend that money in more valuable goods. It is true that
employers tend to want to keep money for themselves as profit. But the
knowledge required to operate complex machinery also grows, which is a
barrier of entry for other potential employees.</p>
<h2 id="compound-value">Compound Value</h2>
<p>The second derivative is that more productive employers have more
money to invest in factory tooling. As time goes by the quality of tools
goes up, which in turn enables the next cycle of investments With better
tools tolerances and clearances will go down, which means that the
machines built can be more useful. Precision engineering has allowed us
to have millimeter-thick screws and supersonic airplanes and
computers.</p>
<p>Oh, let me tell you about general purpose computers. In a sense they
are the ultimate productivity tools: they can run random programs to do
any tasks and can also be augmented with custom software. Computers can
also drive lots of different hardware, from weather sensors to
industrial printers.</p>
<p>Computers can indeed control entire production lines. Now we are not
only speaking about increasing productivity for one worker, but
optimizing entire factories. The value of good tools compounds over
time.</p>
<h2 id="exponential-value">üèí Exponential Value</h2>
<p>Can this process of increasing value accelerate even more? Have we
found the <em>perpetuum mobile</em> of productivity? Well, up to a
point.</p>
<p>Compound interest leads to exponential savings. We have to assume
that there is some limit somewhere: at some point we cannot optimize a
process any longer. The old dream of a single person running a fully
automated factory is still not possible, and production is just a single
aspect of a company. But when we move to the software industry this
limit is even further away. Companies like Google and Amazon showed us
that one sysadmin could first herd a bunch of servers, then a rack and
at some point a whole datacenter.</p>
<p>In my mind, the whole point of software startups, hockey-stick
exponential curves and hypergrowth is precisely that we are building
better tools ‚Äì for other people or for ourselves.</p>
<h1 id="taking-care-of-tooling">üí∞ Taking Care of Tooling</h1>
<p>But we cannot disregard internal tooling; after all it‚Äôs what makes
us productive when building the next generation of tools.</p>
<h2 id="good-professionals">Good Professionals</h2>
<p>There‚Äôs the old adage of ‚Äúgood professionals do good work even with
crappy tools‚Äù. Sure, just like in the awesome scene from the movie <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(2013_film)">Rush (2013)</a>,
Niki Lauda can run really fast in a Lancia Flavia 2000; but he will not
be winning any F1 championships any time soon in that tin can.</p>
<p>Would you ask a good butcher to slice a lamb leg with a butter knife?
Just as well you might ask a developer to write a web application in a
very low-level programming language, like assembler. In my experience
good professionals can recognize and make good use of the best tools;
and they take care of their tooling.</p>
<h2 id="building-tools">ü¶æ Building Tools</h2>
<h2 id="tools-that-improve-themselves">Tools that Improve
Themselves</h2>
<p>The ultimate tool that we have is language. But not everyone uses
language the same way.</p>
<h2 id="dog-fooding">Dog Fooding</h2>
<h2 id="code-as-tooling">Code as Tooling</h2>
<p>As my friend Luis Medel so carefully explains in his excellent
Spanish article <a
href="https://luismedel.com/palabras/la-martingala-del-software/">‚ÄúLa
martingala del software‚Äù</a>, software is a tool in itself. And just as
any language, it is a tool that can operate on itself.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h1>
<p>Tooling is the ultimate investment for a company. If you want to
differentiate yourself from the competition start with having better
tools.</p>
