									</header>
																				<p>During my bumpy career as CTO (2019 ~ 2023) I have often struggled to
make the case for better developer tooling. For me it was a no-brainer:
paying developers a good chunk of money to wait for automated tests to
finish, or to do the same change 10 times over in different places,
seems like a huge waste.</p>

<p>I have focused on improving internal tooling whenever I had the
chance, even devoting some people full time to the task. But I have
often failed to show the value of this investment to (other) company
founders: the general opinion was that devs were only valuable when
working on product features. After all, features are seen as value,
while internal tooling is at best a necessary evil.</p>
<p>For now I will offer a couple of data points in favor of my position.
Some big tech companies (<a
href="https://github.com/jhuangtw/xg2xg">Google</a> and <a
href="https://dev.to/ian808/replacing-the-internal-tooling-we-used-at-meta-facebook-5hh8">Meta</a>
come to mind) are recognized as having great internal tooling; this is
in large part what enables them to be ahead of the competition. And Joel
Spolsky, creator of StackOverflow and Trello, features tooling in
several of the points of his legendary <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">Joel
Test</a>, used to evaluate the quality of a software team. Specifically
point 9 in the list says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me make the argument now in long form, so hopefully we will all
enjoy the benefits of better tooling some time soon.</p>
<h1 id="the-value-of-tools">üí∞ The Value of Tools</h1>
<p>In many professional areas there are almost religious wars about
tooling. This is even more pronounced in software development, where the
arguments between e.g.¬†proponents of the vim and Emacs text editors have
been raging on for years. And they are probably more than justified.</p>
<p>Our starting point should not be controversial: the value of work
performed by a professional is augmented by the tools they use. A farmer
that has to pick potatoes one by one will be 10 times more productive
when they employ a potato collector, and again 10 times more when
collection is done using a tractor. The value of their work goes up
accordingly.</p>
<p>This is, simply put, why the industrial revolution raised the living
standards of people. When an employee manufactures 10 times more screws
the employer has the potential to pay more, and then this person can go
out and spend that money in more valuable goods. It is true that
employers tend to want to keep money for themselves as profit. But the
knowledge required to operate complex machinery also grows, which is a
barrier of entry for other potential employees; skilled operators will
demand better salaries. Everyone benefits.</p>
<h2 id="compound-value">üìà Compound Value</h2>
<p>The second derivative is that more productive employers have more
money to invest in factory tooling, which in turn improves productivity.
As time goes by the quality of the tools goes up, and this enables the
next cycle of investments. With better tools in a factory tolerances and
clearances will go down, which means that the machines built can be more
useful. Precision engineering has allowed us to have millimeter-thick
screws and supersonic airplanes and computers. The value of good tools
thus compounds over time.</p>
<p>Oh, let me tell you about general purpose computers. In a sense they
are the ultimate productivity tools: they can run random commercial
programs to do many tasks, and they can be augmented with custom
software. Computers can drive lots of different hardware, from weather
sensors to industrial printers.</p>
<p>Properly coded programs can indeed control entire production lines.
Now we are not only speaking about increasing productivity for one
worker, but optimizing entire factories.</p>
<h2 id="exponential-value">üèí Exponential Value</h2>
<p>Can this process of increasing value accelerate even more? Have we
found the <em>perpetuum mobile</em> of productivity? Well, up to a
point.</p>
<p>In banking, compound interest leads to exponential savings. In our
case, compound improvements lead to exponential value. We have to assume
that there is some limit somewhere: at some point we cannot optimize a
process any longer. The old dream of a single person running a fully
automated factory is still not possible, and production is just a single
aspect of a company. But when we move to the software industry this
limit is even further away. Companies like Google and Amazon showed us
that one sysadmin could first herd a bunch of servers, then a rack and
at some point a whole data center. Nowadays I doubt sysadmins ever log
in to individual servers.</p>
<p>In my mind, the whole point of software startups, hockey-stick
exponential curves and hypergrowth is precisely that we are building
better tools ‚Äì for other people or for ourselves. Sometimes for both, as
we will see below when we speak about dog-fooding. Uber is in a sense
just a productivity tool that matches drivers with riders more
efficiently; everything else is financial wizardry to collect the
benefits.</p>
<p>Once you are into this frame of mind you will see tools everywhere.
For productivity, financial improvement, for better living or just for
entertainment; any <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies">list
of unicorns</a> is just a catalog of more efficient tools. Google
transformed a few categories when they offered better tools for search,
email and targeted ads; Apple is the ultimate hardware toolmaker. And so
on.</p>
<h1 id="taking-care-of-tooling">üß∞ Taking Care of Tooling</h1>
<p>Let us now focus on internal tooling: after all it‚Äôs what makes us
productive to build the next generation of tools. If your tools are the
same as or worse than what your competition is using, how do you expect
to do better than them?</p>
<h2 id="nice-things">üßë‚Äçüîß Nice Things</h2>
<p>In <em>The Existential Pleasures of Engineering</em> (1976, second
Edition 1994), Floorman tells us the great pleasure with which Homer
speaks in the <em>Iliad</em> about how various objects are made. There
is great pleasure in nicely made tools. We can still get that feeling
with a nicely machined computer, and YouTube is rife with videos about
people building stuff.</p>
<p>Some people tend to think that good professionals do their best even
with crappy tools. Sure, just like in the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kl0UBS4ZaM">awesome scene</a>
from the movie <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(2013_film)">Rush (2013)</a>,
Niki Lauda can run really fast in a Lancia Flavia 2000; but he will not
be winning any F1 championships any time soon in that tin can.</p>
<p>Would you ask a good butcher to slice a lamb leg with a butter knife?
Just as well you might ask a developer to write a web application in a
very low-level programming language, like assembler. Good tools are not
enough either; you need good professionals to make the best use of them.
In my experience they will take great care to choose and maintain their
tooling.</p>
<p>They will also strive to keep their working space clean. As my friend
Luis Medel narrates in his excellent Spanish article <a
href="https://luismedel.com/palabras/la-martingala-del-software/">‚ÄúLa
martingala del software‚Äù</a>, as he was watching carpenters work he was
mesmerized by how they always took the time to clean the working area
and the power tools they had used.</p>
<h2 id="building-stuff">ü¶æ Building Stuff</h2>
<p>Now if we look at <em>great</em> professionals, they are able not
just to pick great tools and take care of them; they can also build
their own.</p>
<p>While I don‚Äôt pretend to be a great professional, I have polluted the
tooling space with my feeble attempts. My mildly successful <a
href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadtest">npm loadtest package</a>
has been amply surpassed by the much better <a
href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/autocannon">AutoCannon</a> by Matteo
Collina. I‚Äôm still actively working on <a
href="https://librecounter.org/">LibreCounter.org</a>, which is a little
package to collect site stats without any of those pesky cookies. I
enjoy working on it a lot.</p>
<p>You may be wondering, why build your own when there‚Äôs so much stuff
out there already? Sometimes you are too early in a space and there are
not yet tools to fall in love with; I started doing <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2012/continuous-deployment">continuous
deployment</a> using Node.js in 2013 when there were not any good
packages, so I <a
href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/deployment/commits/master/">built
my own pitiful attempt</a>. It worked for us at the time in my company;
later on we adopted a better package.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need something which is too specific or niche.
Knowing <a href="https://pinchito.es/2016/build-or-not">when to
build</a> is an excellent skill to have. Also knowing what to build is
important: <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2022/building-bridges">underengineering</a> is
as bad as overengineering, and should be just as infamous.</p>
<h2 id="software-developer-toolset">üßë‚Äçüíª Software Developer Toolset</h2>
<p>In the software development realm we are blessed with a multitude of
great tools, thanks to the great developers before us that created them.
There are many code-specific utilities: compilers, code checkers (or
linters), continuous integration. Learning to use this machinery is
essential for a good dev. Luckily the best in class tend to be free
software (open source), so in practice they are freely available.</p>
<p>One of the most important arrows in our quiver is the source code
manager, a space that has been dominated of late by <a
href="https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual"><code>git</code></a>.
Created by Linus Torvalds, one of the greatest developers of our time,
<code>git</code> stores changes as ‚Äúcommits‚Äù or incremental
modifications. Care of our working space in this case includes having a
clean <code>git</code> history, and clean branches. A messy piling of
commits and branches is always a symptom of careless or incompetent
developers. One of my pet peeves is to always stash commits together
every time they are merged (as pull requests or merge requests), so that
it is easy to find out where a change comes from. Also remove branches
once they are no longer needed.</p>
<p>There are many other crucial tools that ensure our success as devs.
Some like monitoring and alerting can be provided by external companies.
Others like feature flags are basically techniques that should be
used</p>
<p>The most dear to my heart of these is <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2012/continuous-deployment">continuous
deployment</a>: it allows devs to deploy code to production with every
change, many times per day. It definitely changes the relationship with
code: it is seen as something dynamic that can be fluidly turned into
something else.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure that these internal tools are constantly tuned
and optimized is to assign them to a developer, or even better to a
team. I‚Äôve seen them neglected because they were everybody‚Äôs
responsibility, and therefore nobody‚Äôs. Over time, platform (or
similarly named) teams have taken responsibility for internal tooling.
While they are not working on visible features, these devs will
accelerate everyone else. Their value is therefore not obvious at first,
but crucial in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="the-tool-that-improves-itself">üó£Ô∏è The Tool that Improves
Itself</h2>
<p>Now let‚Äôs take an excursion into a more theoretical area: linguistics
and grammar. There is a point to it, I promise, and I hope it will be
worth your while.</p>
<p>The ultimate tool that we have is language. As I have <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2017/origins-language">speculated
elsewhere</a> it must have developed slowly at first as we evolved, and
then exploded in a myriad of words.</p>
<p>But not everyone uses language the same way. In particular, <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind">philosophy and grammar
were born hand in hand</a>. Grammar is, simply put, language turning on
itself: people speaking about language. As the great Garc√≠a Calvo used
to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language is the only tool that operates on itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And consequently we can use it to improve how we speak. This is a
turning point in our development as tool makers. Great wordsmiths like
Shakespeare have innovated in language: the Immortal Bard <a
href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-words/">created
or introduced 1700 words</a> for the English language. While J R R
Tolkien created <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_constructed_by_Tolkien">no
less than 15 languages</a> for his fictitious Middle Earth.</p>
<h2 id="code-as-tooling">‚å®Ô∏è Code as Tooling</h2>
<p>Medel‚Äôs article mentioned above, <a
href="https://luismedel.com/palabras/la-martingala-del-software/">‚ÄúLa
martingala del software‚Äù</a>, made me think how software can be seen as
just another tool. And just as any natural language, programming
languages can operate on themselves. As such, code is the ultimate
machine: it is absurdly versatile and infinitely malleable. A modern
computer can handle insane amounts of information, and correctly
programmed it can generate any arbitrary output and handle any task. No
other human invention compares.</p>
<p>Just as good professionals take care of their tools, good developers
should always keep their code in good shape. A large part of of the
value of code is in how well it adapts to different situations, and
therefore it is our responsibility as devs to make sure we can perform
whatever modifications are required, as fast as possible. Code which
just grows without any refactoring becomes an amorphous blob which
scares any poor souls that venture into its depths.</p>
<p>A very interesting code tool is testing. Unit, integration and
end-to-end tests can be <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2012/automating-the-automation">automated</a>,
which ensures that any modifications can be performed without
introducing new bugs. Having a running test suite (often called CI
suite) should be the second priority of any dev team, after keeping the
production environment used by customers. No excuses: any failing tests
have to be dealt with immediately.</p>
<p>Over time, the success of software as a paradigm has ensured the rise
of infrastructure-as-code, which essentially means treating basic
infrastructure (servers, operating systems, installed programs) as code
with its own repo and tooling. It is not just different tools, but a
very different framework. The same has happened, to an extent, to data
engineering; and more of this is sure to happen in the future.</p>
<h2 id="dog-fooding">üêï‚Äçü¶∫ Dog Fooding</h2>
<p>This curious term comes from the pet food industry, where apparently
some owners insisted on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">eating
your own dog food</a>. It means that a company that produces a product
should use it for everything. The interesting effect is that developers
learn the pain that other users have, and become so very interested in
improving the tool. Making the tech team aware of customer pains can be
laborious since it‚Äôs usually mediated by customer representatives and
‚Äúcustomer success‚Äù teams.</p>
<p>I learned as much when creating my GDPR-compliant privacy-conscious
web tracker, <a href="https://librecounter.org/">LibreCounter</a>. I
used it to see how many people were <a
href="https://librecounter.org/librecounter.org/show">visiting the
site</a>, and what they were looking at. Usually it‚Äôs developers
checking their stats.</p>

<p>Tooling is the ultimate investment for a company. If you want to
differentiate yourself from the competition start with having better
tools.</p>
