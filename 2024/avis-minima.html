										<p>üõ©Ô∏è Building A Prototype Airship Drone<p>
									</header>
																				<p>The worlds of airships and of drones are really interesting on their
own, but have a suspiciously lean intersection. I am currently in the
process of designing and building an airship drone (or drone airship): a
flying machine that can stay aloft for a long time, perhaps
indefinitely.</p>

<h1 id="the-project">The Project</h1>
<p>This is a very interesting project because it touches many different
areas: from papiroflexia to avionics software.</p>
<h2 id="mvp-minimum-volant-prototype">MVP: Minimum Volant Prototype</h2>
<p>Building a 100 meter long dirigible is not a project for an amateur.
As sizes get smaller they become more attainable. So, how small can we
get and still have a working drone?</p>
<p>With airships weight is always the primary concern: if they are to
float in the air, the weight of the ship must be exactly balanced with
the equivalent volume of air. Density of air is approximately 1.2 kg/m3;
once we choose a shape we can scale it up and down by simply following
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">law
of squares and cubes</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>We will reuse the shape from the <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2024/aves-aeternae">Aves √Ütern√¶ article</a>:
an ellipsoid with a major axis twice the minor axis. The size of the
major axis will determine the weight of the structure:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see the weight quickly becomes impractical for a drone: it
is very much impossible with the current state of the art to build a 50
cm dirigible, since total weight would have to be under 20 grams. We
would need a few grams left to include any kind of electronics: even a
paltry <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano">Arduino
nano</a> weighs in at 5 grams. What can we do with the remaining 15
grams?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://planetcalc.com/149/">surface of the
ellipsoid</a> would be approximately 0.34 m2, and covering it up with
just one layer of 20 microns ligthweight material (1.2 density) would be
8 grams. (For comparison, the lightest vegetable bags at a supermarket
are 40~50 microns thick.) Really hard to fit in the remaining 7 grams a
couple of motors, propellers, battery and control surfaces; not to speak
about some kind of structure, plus about one gram of hydrogen. Believe
me, I‚Äôve tried.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to remain at these scales when a bigger prototype
is easier to build. Let‚Äôs go up a notch. Is it possible to build a
1-meter long dirigible and keep within the 150 gram budget? This is our
current project, the <em>avis minima</em>: the smallest practical
airship drone that is still capable of flight. Just as tech companies
build an MVP, or <em>minimum viable prototype</em>, we face the
construction of this <em>minimum volant prototype</em>.</p>
<h2 id="autonomous-flight">Autonomous Flight</h2>
<p>The concept of drone used to mean UAV or ‚Äúunmanned aerial vehicle‚Äù,
and include a complete fly-by-wire system of autonomous flight. However
radio-control or RC drones have become quite popular, negating the
autonomous nature of the previous models.</p>
<p>Our ambition is to have a completely self-reliant drone that is able
to set course. It will only receive instructions on where to go, and
decide its own flight plan. We are immensely helped by the buoyant
nature of the avis minima. Aircraft have <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes">three
principal axes</a>: yaw, pitch and roll. We only have to set yaw, since
we will in principle not change altitude nor roll.</p>
<p>The electronics have thus to manage avionics and navigation, and some
way of communication: at least be able to set objectives. We have chosen
the <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble/">Arduino nano
BLE</a> as the brains of the operation, since it is small, light (~5
grams) and comes packed with sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>3-axis accelerometers,</li>
<li>3-axis gyroscopes,</li>
<li>and 3-axis magnetometers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is actually possible to build an inertial navigation system (INS)
with these 9-axis sensors. Such a system is capable of inferring the
position and orientation at any point, without any external information.
But they are noisy and imprecise.</p>
<p>Ideally we will use GPS for navigation, although modules are heavy (I
have not seen anything under ~15g) and slow. Many people recommend
having GPS for slow positioning, and filling in for the short term with
an INS.</p>
<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna">original
article from 2023</a> I explored the principles of long-lasting flight:
a properly configured drone might be able to fly for weeks if not
months. The avis minima prototype is not so ambitious: I would be happy
to see it fly for a few hours. We will have time to prolong flight time
with bigger models.</p>
<p>Luckily Lithium ion polymer (or LiPo) batteries are small and
lightweight. The drone industry has here once again come to our rescue:
there are in the market of all sizes and denominations. But we will go a
different way: drone batteries are optimized for output, while in our
case we hardly require a quick energy discharge.</p>
<p>A 500 mAh powerbank is all we need. They even come with a nice
facility: the ability to charge using USB. This also has allowed us to
power up the Arduino nano directly from the USB port. Luckily there are
also highly convenient, half-gram voltage converters from the 3.7 V of
the LiPo battery to the 3.3 V required by the Arduino.</p>
<p>The target power of the avis minima is 1 Watt. Energy consumption
from the Arduino nano is minimal at 10 mA and 3.3 V (0.033 Watt), and
can even be lowered by disabling the onboard LED. Most of the 1W will go
to the propellers. A 500 mAh battery at 3.7 V will <a
href="https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/mah-to-wh-calculator.html">yield
1.85 Watt-hour</a>, so it will be able to power the avis for almost two
hours straight.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs one trick up our sleeve: lightweight solar panels that can be
installed in place of stabilizers, and that yield a lot of power (3.5 W
nominal) at 6 grams. These panels should be able to power the propellers
directly. If we can leave the battery only to power the Arduino nano, it
will be able of 50+ hours of operation.</p>
<h2 id="outer-hull">Outer Hull</h2>
<p>Fans of papiroflexia will be happy with this section. The outer
surface is 1.34 square meters. To cover it we need a lightweight and yet
sturdy material, such as‚Ä¶ maybe paper?</p>
<p>Sadly even office paper is 80 gsm (grams per square meter), so
covering our 1.34 m2 would weigh us down by 107g. But what if we can
find something lighter and stronger?</p>
<p>I created a prototype with humble oven paper from the kitchen supply
section of the supermarket. At 40 gsm it is quite sturdy, but with the
necessary glue it grew up to 50 gsm, for a total of 67 grams. Luckily
Asian paper manufacturers have created wonders of human ingenuity:
Japanese unryu paper can be found at 20 gsm which is sturdier than
regular paper. I am partial to manila paper, sourced from a local shop,
which at 19 gsm is even lighter and quite sturdy.</p>
<p>The paper has to be cut properly so that it will generate an
ellipsoid. I found <a href="xxx">this video</a> of an ingenious lady
building a paper sphere, with each segment being a sinusoid. Sadly
ellipsoids are quite intractable mathematically; I created this script
to generate the proper shape that, once folded, generates an ellipsoid.
Each segment is approximately 10 cm wide and 62 cm long, and has
indentations to glue it to its neighbours. Each four segments join
together to form a quarter half-shape, so we need 32 in total for the
whole shape.</p>
<p>I have done some prototypes with scissors and they are a huge pain to
cut. Luckily I now have access to a laser cutter which makes short work
of the segments.</p>
<p>After gluing together the segments they form two half-spheroids, that
have to be joined together with the structure inside. Finally, a coating
of acrylic spray gives it a water-resistant finish.</p>
<h2 id="hydrogen-prejudice">Hydrogen Prejudice</h2>
<p>We have to fill up the interior with something lighter than air, and
the lightest gas known is hydrogen. Wait, did you read right? Doesn‚Äôt
hydrogen, like, burn? Why not helium?</p>
<p>The answer is threefold: price, convenience and availability. Helium
is at least 100‚Ç¨/m3 in Spain, and the avis requires 0.131 m3. It is also
a scarce resource and very likely to go up in price, since it is used
for MRI machines which are more valuable than party balloons.</p>
<p>Helium is also twice as heavy as hydrogen; the avis would have to
store 18 instead of 9 grams, wasting 9 grams of payload. Hydrogen is
famously hard to contain in an envelope but helium is even worse, as it
is a monoatomic molecule.</p>
<p>As to safety: 9 grams of hydrogen is not explosive enough to cause
any damage, and we don‚Äôt have human passengers anyway.</p>
<p>Allow me to address directly the Hindenburg catastrophe that has been
impinged into our collective subsconsious. The problem with Zeppelins
was not with hydrogen but with the rigid design that was so popular. The
great Spanish inventor Torres Quevedo <a
href="https://www.torresquevedo.org/LTQ10/images/Dirigible_Journal_TorresQuevedo.pdf">designed
and patented a line of dirigibles</a> that ruled the air using hydrogen
for 30+ years, with no accidents except for a couple of war casualties.
Their semi-rigid structure allowed for handling bumps gracefully, unlike
the German, British and Italian competition which all ended in multiple
disasters.</p>
<p>Also, as seen on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSDmlj-u6QM">Mythbusters</a>:
don‚Äôt paint the envelope in thermite if at all possible.</p>
<h1 id="project-details">Project Details</h1>
<p>Now we will go into the nitty gritty details of the project. These
are likely to change as the project moves along.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-tech-specs">Preliminary Tech Specs</h2>
<p>While it is quite premature to set in stone every detail of the
project, it is good to have an idea of the main parameters.</p>

<p>Weight is computed based on the volume of air displaced, using an
average air density of 1.2 kg/m3 (sea level, 20 C). One of the
challenges is that this weight can change with temperature, altitude and
even atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p>Note that we have around 150 grams to fit in everything: hydrogen
container, outer envelope, structure and propulsion. We will set up a
preliminary ‚Äúweight budget‚Äù of &lt;40 grams for each of these areas.</p>
<h2 id="propulsion">Propulsion</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with this interesting area: how to have powered flight
below 40 grams.</p>
<h3 id="propelling">Propelling</h3>
<p>The Arduino nano will control a couple of motors using motor drivers.
Very <a
href="https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005001649480303.html">lightweight
brushless motors</a> are available: 2g each, as the vendor explicitly
shows on the article page. Propellers under 1g can also be found.</p>
<p>Similarly <a
href="https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005006099884636.html">lightweight
motor drivers</a> are available that convert the signal from the Arduino
to triphasic current required by the brushless motors.</p>
<h3 id="other-electronics">Other Electronics</h3>
<p>There are a few other line items in our propulsion budget. First we
need cables to connect the Arduino to the motors, which will span at
least from the gondola to each propeller (~40 cm) and from the gondola
to the servo (~62 cm), with three cables each (power, ground and
signal). Let‚Äôs give a few more cm for each cable, this gives us a total
of 5 meters of cable:</p>
<p>L = 3 * 2 * 50 cm + 3 * 70 cm ~ 5 m.</p>
<p>We need really lightweight cable; luckily we can use <a
href="https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07JBQQR38?th=1">AWG 32 enameled
cables</a>, which are around 0.1 g/m, for half a gram total.</p>
<p>We also need JST connectors to facilitate changing each piece. We can
use 6 sets of JST PH (2 mm) connectors, weighing around 0.1 g each, for
a total of around half a gram.</p>
<p>Lastly we need a <a
href="https://www.motionrc.eu/products/rotorscale-1g-high-speed-digital-nano-servo-rsh6005-001">servo
motor</a> that will pop open the hydrogen bag, for emergency stops. We
cannot have a rogue drone flying around, so whenever things go wrong the
brains will use this servo to open the bag.</p>
<h3 id="propulsion-weight-budget">Propulsion Weight Budget</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs see if we are within the 40 g budget.</p>

</table>
<p>We are well below budget! Just as well, because we will certainly go
above in one of the remaining groups.</p>
<h2 id="outer-hull-1">Outer Hull</h2>
<p>As we saw above, we will use 20 gsm paper (manila or unryu) for
maximum lightness; that is 20 g/m2. We will need a bit over 1.34 m2,
since the different segments will overlap a bit; let‚Äôs say 1.40 m2. This
means 28 g of paper.</p>
<p>We also need glue to keep it together, and an outer layer of acrylic
spray. Weight of glued paper tends to go up something like 5 g/m2.
Finally spray also increases weight around 5 g/m2. Each material will
add around 7 g.</p>
<h3 id="hull-weight-budget">Hull Weight Budget</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs see if we are within the 40 g budget.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>We go a bit above 40 g.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The structure is made up of a series of joints at the edges, linked
together by carbon fiber strips. The two motors and the gondola are
attached to these joints.</p>
<p>The gondola will house Arduino nano, battery and a power converter
from the battery‚Äôs 3.7 V to the Arduino‚Äôs 3.3 V, which is a very simple
and lightweight 0.6 g circuit.</p>
<p>As to the carbon fiber structure, we need 8 strips 62 cm long, and 4
strips 40 cm long, for a total of 656 cm. I have tried with 3x0.3 mm
strips. They just weigh 1.1 g/m for a total of but they cannot hold the
weight of the gondola. I am currently waiting for 3x0.5 mm and 5x0.5mm
strips; they weigh a bit more. Since carbon fiber has density of 1.4
g/cm3, it is easy to compute linear density:</p>
<p>d = 1.4 g/cm3 * 3 mm * 0.3 mm</p>
<ul>
<li>3 * 0.3 mm: 1.26 g/m</li>
<li>3 * 0.5 mm: 2.1 g/m</li>
<li>5 * 0.5 mm: 3.5 g/m</li>
</ul>
<p>Weight goes up fast! We can use the thickest strips only for the
bottom segments, ~2 meters of them: 2 strips with 62 cm and 2 with 40
cm. Then intermediate strips for the mid segments (4x62cm), and the
thinner strips on top (another 2m).</p>

</figure>
<p>Note how the four strips holding the gondola at the bottom are the
thickest. It remains to be seen if this structure will be able to hold
the weight of the gondola and the remaining parts such as ailerons, or
it will need crossing reinforcements.</p>

<p>Right within budget!</p>
<h2 id="hydrogen-bag">Hydrogen Bag</h2>
<p>Now we come to the most delicate and most sketchy of design issues:
how do we store the hydrogen within the avis? Once again we have less
than 40 grams for the whole thing.</p>
<h3 id="pva-to-the-rescue">PVA to the Rescue</h3>
<p>The best material to contain hydrogen is apparently PVA, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_alcohol">density of
1.2~1.3 g/cm3</a>. For our 1.34 m2 a 20 micron bag would therefore
represent 32~35 grams. Let‚Äôs go on the pessimistic side to account for
any extra plastic needed for the bag.</p>
<h3 id="get-hydrogen">Get Hydrogen</h3>
<p>We need 9 grams of hydrogen to fill our 0.131 m3, at 70 g/m3.</p>
<p>Hydrogen availability is not trivial either: it can be purchased in
heavy bottles, but it has the advantage that it can be generated quite
easily via electrolysis. Actually just put an AA battery in water; those
bubbles you see at one end are pure hydrogen!</p>
<p>There are portable generators sold supposedly for medical benefits,
like <a href="https://www.ebay.es/itm/294917973530">this one</a>. No
idea if they are reliable enough. We need 131 liters so using this
method would take around 15 hours; it would not be fast.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h1>
<p>When downscaling the avis aeterna to one meter long I expected to
find multiple roadblocks. To my surprise it should be possible to build
it with current materials and methods! While it will probably not stay
aloft for days or weeks, it is a nice demonstration of the concept that
can be scaled up.</p>
