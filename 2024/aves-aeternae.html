										<p>🛩️ Building Perpetual Flying Machines<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Last year I published an article about <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna">perpetual flying
machines</a>: flying machines that could stay aloft indefinitely. The
initial numbers were intriguing: the concept was viable. But nobody has
done it yet. Should we accept the challenge?</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/aves-aeternae-model.png"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Plans for a model airship.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="building-models">🏗️ Building Models</h1>
<p>I set up to build more detailed plans with a given scale in mind. I
expected to find a wall at any point where the required technology just
wasn’t available, or it was too exotic to be purchased just yet. To my
surprise there were no showstoppers: the technology is here, and
everything seems to be feasible, right now. The engineering challenge is
thus amazingly possible.</p>
<h2 id="model-scale">🎚️ Model Scale</h2>
<p>So let’s build a scale model! In what follows we will look at a 2×2×4
meter model, more or less the size of a car: big enough to be
substantial, but small enough to be built with limited means.</p>
<h3 id="proportions">🏉 Proportions</h3>
<p>The classical design for a blimp or a zeppelin is a spheroid. (Yes, I
know that last time I chose a design similar to a boat: square and flat
profile. I have since come to appreciate a more classic design.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/aves-ellipsoid.png"
title="3D rendering of an ellipsoid, a stretched sphere or the shape of a rugby ball."

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A spheroid or ellipsoid. Source: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ellipsoid_Quadric.png">Sam
Derbyshire, Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is quite aerodynamic, or should be: the drag coefficient of a
spheroid is between 0.02 and 0.04, according to <a
href="https://doi.org/10.2514/1.14796">GE Dorrington in “Drag of
Spheroid-Cone Shaped Airship”</a>. Also it is simple to model and build.
So let’s go with a spheroid!</p>
<h3 id="dimensions">📏 Dimensions</h3>
<p>An intriguing option is to size the avis aeterna vaguely like a car:
two meters wide and tall, four meters long. (For US readers: that is 6.5
feet wide and tall, 13 feet long.) It is big enough to be substantial,
but small enough to be built in a garage.</p>
<p>This mandates all of the proportions of the model: with the value of
two meters and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid">spheroid</a> equations we
can compute everything else. First we have a prolate spheroid with axis
<code>A=2m</code>, and length <code>C=4m</code>. The volume contained
becomes:</p>
<p><code>V = πA²C/6 ≈ A²C/2,</code></p>
<p>which is a surprisingly accurate formula (actual factor above should
be 0.523). In our case:</p>
<p><code>V ≈ 2m × 2m × 4m / 2 = (2m)³ = 8 m³.</code></p>
<p>And the area is very approximately:</p>
<p><code>S ≈ 5 × 2m × 2m = 5 × 4m² = 20 m².</code></p>
<p>These are the basic parameters of our model.</p>
<h3 id="weight">⚖️ Weight</h3>
<p>You may remember that the plan was to fill the airship with hydrogen:
even lighter than helium, and quite cheaper. For an uncrewed vehicle the
risks are negligible. Also, for a continuously flying machine hydrogen
can be replenished in flight, as we will see later.</p>
<p>How much will our model weight? Exactly as much as the air displaced
by the hydrogen: we compute the weight of the air inside, and then
subtract the weight of the same volume of hydrogen. Since the density of
air is 1.3 kg/m³, and of hydrogen is 70 g/m³, lift will be:</p>
<p>`L = (1.3 - 0.070) kg/m³ × 8 m³ ≈ 9.84 kg.</p>
<p>So our budget is around 10 kg. As you see, at this stage it’s not
enough to do Fermi estimations (i.e. order of magnitude): for a detailed
feasibility study we need more precise numbers. It is still OK to round
up numbers as we did above with surface and volume.</p>
<h2 id="build">🛠️ Build</h2>
<p>How can we build a real life airship, even if it’s a small one?</p>
<h3 id="structure">🪚 Structure</h3>
<p>We want to build a dirigible: an aircraft which is sustented by the
lift of a light gas.</p>
<p>real dirigible, not a blimp: the difference is that the dirigible or
zeppelin has a rigid structure, while blimps are just inflatable. We
know that dirigibles worked beautifully, and with ancient 1900s
materials even, but is it possible to do it at this scale?</p>
<p>Let’s go with the simplest structure: just a shell. We can set up a
rigid hull that contains a sack, which in turn holds our lifting gas.
What is the weight per square meter that we can afford?</p>
<p>First we have to set up a budget: how much of our 10 kg we want to
spend in the shell. It seems obvious that this is going to be our
biggest source of weight, and that we should reserve for it as much as
we can afford: a stronger structure is going to hold up better against
strong winds or impacts. Let us say half our weight is for the
structure.</p>
<p>We have to reserve some weight for the wings and other parts. Let us
say 4 kg for the hull. Since we have 20 m² of surface, the areal density
will be:</p>
<pre><code>D(A) = 4 kg / 20 m²,
D(A) = 200 g/m².</code></pre>
<p>What kind of material can be strong enough at 0.2 kg per square
meter? Only <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers">carbon
fiber</a> fits the bill. It is a very interesting material made of
carbon fibers embedded in an epoxy resin, which when cured results in
super strong panels.</p>
<h3 id="wings-and-reinforcements">🪽 Wings and Reinforcements</h3>
<p>We set aside a budget of one kg for the rest of the hull.</p>
<p>The wings need also be built using carbon fiber. They need to be even
stronger than the outer shell. Two wings and a tail on top are of the
same approximate dimensions: 60 x 80 cm, for a total area of approx. one
third of a m². The three share an area of 1 m². The areal density needs
to be at least twice of the shell, probably 500 g/m², for a total weight
of 0.5 kg.</p>
<p>Also some reinforcements are required where the parts are joined. It
is impossible to build the hull in one go; different pieces have to
built and assembled. In our case we can build eight identical panels,
which is quite convenient from the manufacture point of view. Then they
can be assembled together using reinforcements, built using carbon fiber
and glass fiber for elasticity.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/aves-aeternae-hull.png"
title="A spheroid cut in eight: seen from the top an ellipse cut in four pieces. Source: the author."
alt="Eight pieces of the hull: four on top, four below." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eight pieces of the hull: four on top,
four below.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally we need a small cone to place at the front. Together the
budget of 1 kg seems doable.</p>
<h3 id="hydrogen-sack">🎈 Hydrogen Sack</h3>
<p>Inside the hull a large bag will hold the gas. At this scale we don’t
want a complicated set of sacks containing the hydrogen; just one big
bag will do.</p>
<p>Helium balloons are usually done with Mylar, but there are materials
that leak even less hydrogen: PVA is a very strong contender.</p>
<p>In <a
href="https://rest.neptune-prod.its.unimelb.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/9a2af3f4-a7c8-467a-ba32-ade91ba45822/content">Lei
<em>et al</em></a> the team experiment with several coatings, finding
that PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) has the lowest hydrogen permeability.</p>
<p>Luckily it is not hard to get PVA bags, as they are widely used in
industry because they are biodegradable. One precaution is that PVA
dissolves in water, so the interior of the structure must be kept
dry.</p>
<p>Bags with thickness of 40 microns are quite common in the industry.
Given the density of PVA of 1.19 g/cm³, for our total surface of 20 m²
we get:</p>
<pre><code>W(bag) ≈ 0.040 mm × 1.19 g/cm³ × 20 m²
W(bag) ≈ 950 g ≈ 1 kg</code></pre>
<p>So another kg for our weight budget.</p>
<h3 id="hydrogen-leaks">💨 Hydrogen Leaks</h3>
<p>How much hydrogen would leak out of our PVA bag in a day? This of
course depends on how well sealed the bag is, and the quality of the
materials. We can use a unit of permeability called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrer">Barrer</a> to quantify it.
Again in <a
href="https://rest.neptune-prod.its.unimelb.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/9a2af3f4-a7c8-467a-ba32-ade91ba45822/content">Lei
<em>et al</em></a> the permeability of PVA is given as 0.0084 barrer.
Given the definition of 1 barrer in SI units:</p>
<p><code>1 barrer = 3.35 × 10^-16 × mol × m / (m² × s × Pa),</code></p>
<p>the computations are a bit messy but can be done as follows. The
leaked gas will be:</p>
<p><code>Quantity = Per × Surface × time × Pressure / thickness,</code></p>
<p>Remember that our surface is 20 m². We will compute the leaked
quantity for a day or 86400 seconds, at atmospheric pressure or 101325
Pascal with a 40 micron bag. Pressure inside the bag will not be much
higher than 1 atm; even <a
href="https://www.mwmresearchgroup.org/the-science-of-balloons-part-2.html">balloons</a>
are only a few percent tighter than atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>Now we have everything to compute the daily leaked quantity
<code>Q</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Q ≈ 0.0084 barrer × 20 m² × 86400 s × 101325 Pa / 0.000040 m,
Q ≈ 0.0084 × 3.35 × 10^-16 × 86400 × 101325 / 0.00004 mol,
Q ≈ 0.0006 mol.</code></pre>
<p>Converting to grams is easy as 1 mol of Hydrogen is defined as 1 g,
so we are leaking a bit more than half a milligram per day. Not bad
considering that we have around 0.5 kg of hydrogen! We might stay aloft
for a million days at this rate. These nubers do not look very
realistic, and have to be contrasted with real world tests with real
bags. But the safety margin is quite large.</p>
<h2 id="energy-sources">⚡ Energy Sources</h2>
<p>The airship needs to be able to direct its flight. It needs a power
source that gives enough energy for our purposes. Being a demonstration
model it doesn’t need to withstand any kind of weather, but it needs to
manouver at a certain speed.</p>
<h3 id="power">🛩️ Power</h3>
<p>How much power do we need? Let’s recall the drag equation:</p>
<p><code>F(D) = ½ ρ × v² × C(D) × S,</code></p>
<p>using the density of air of 1.3 kg/m³, the surface of 20 m² and the
drag coefficient we saw above for a spheroid with a cone of
<code>0.03</code>. (Note: carbon fiber is a very polished surface so the
drag coefficient might be even lower.) Spoiler alert, power is just
force multiplied by velocity, so we just multiply again by the
velocity:</p>
<p><code>P = ½ ρ × v³ × C(D) × S.</code></p>
<p>So the power we need to move at a given velocity will be:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ ½ 1.3 kg/m³ × 0.03 × 20 m² × v³,
P ≈ 0.39 kg/m × v³.</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s set as target speed a leisurely pace of 5 m/s, or 18 km/h
(11 mph). Our avis aeterna is not going to be a speed demon, but it will
move about. The required power will be:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ 0.39 × 5³ kg×m²/s³ ≈ 48.75 W.</code></pre>
<p>Approximately <strong>50 watt of power are needed to move at 5
m/s</strong>. Is this possible to achieve?</p>
<h3 id="motor-and-propeller">⚙️ Motor and Propeller</h3>
<p>From this power budget we have to discount the efficiency of motor
and propeller. Luckily thanks to the RC industry there are a lot of very
efficient motors (brushless and sensored are apparently the way to go)
and propellers which are powerful and light enough.</p>
<p>There is at least a 20% reduction in efficiency due to the
combination of motor and propeller to be taken into account. So our 50 W
of impulse become at least 60 W at generation. Also, the weight of two
motors and two propellers (each at the side of the airship to help keep
the balance) should be well below 500 g.</p>
<h3 id="solar-energy">☀️ Solar Energy</h3>
<p>There are not many renewable sources of energy up in the air. The
most obvious is the Sun: embed some solar panels on top of our hull and
we are good to go!</p>
<p>Ultralight panels are not easy to find. But there are companies
commercializing powerful panels today. One such example is the <a
href="https://www.solbian.eu/en/sp-series/26-sp-24.html">Solbian SP
24</a>, which provides a nominal 82 W with a weight of 1.1 kg.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that solar panels always provide less power than
advertised, even in full sun. So it is possible that at midday in
optimal weather in a temperate country this panel might get to give us
the 60 W we need. We might use a couple of these panels to reach more
power, but then the airship may become top-heavy and destabilize.</p>
<p>It is not unusual to see promises of much more powerful solar cells.
<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/ultrathin-solar-cells-1209">MIT
researchers</a> were promising 370 W/kg in 2022, which would be closer
to what we need. And the Airbus Zephyr uses Microlink solar sheets <a
href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microlink-devices-powers-successful-stratospheric-flight-of-airbus-defence-and-space-zephyr-s-haps-solar-aircraft-300732214.html">exceeding
1500 W/kg</a>, and 350 W/m2.</p>
<p>We might even get to 10 m/s with this kind of power. But keep in mind
that the cubed equation we got above for power is quite treacherous: to
get to 10 m/s we would need 8 times more power than for our 5 m/s, or
480 W. For now we will probably have to keep to our target speed.</p>
<h3 id="wind-energy">🌬️ Wind Energy</h3>
<p>An intriguing possibility, and one which does not require any
technological leaps of faith, is to use wind energy.</p>
<p>But wait, how can you use wind energy to propel yourself if you are
moving in the wind? It’s the same principle as regenerative braking in
electric cars: you let the motor spin freely, and instead of spending
energy to move the wheels, the movement of the wheels charges the
battery. Same principle: Yokota and Fujimoto investigated the principle
in planes in <a
href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejjia/11/2/11_21005706/_pdf">Pitch
Angle Control by Regenerative Air Brake for Electric Aircraft</a>, and
it is perfectly possible if the wings are oriented correctly. It even
decelerates the aircraft, which is logical since the energy is taken
from the flowing air.</p>
<p>So the idea would be: orient the airship so the propellers move
maximally, stop the motor and let it charge the batteries. The craft
would slow down at the same time so it would not be carried away by the
wind so fast. Then, once the batteries are charged start the propellers
and move back to the desired position. This process can be repeated as
often as desired; of course it will not be very efficient but might help
not drift away too much e.g. at night.</p>
<h3 id="batteries">🔋 Batteries</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, is there any of that weight budget left at this
point for the batteries? They are intended to store some of the solar
and wind energy during the day, and use it at night to avoid drifting
away.</p>
<p>We will have to set aside at least 1 kg for a good battery. We can
get <a
href="https://www.jinbei-deutschland.de/en/products/v-mount-battery-180-wh-28309">180
Wh commercially</a> today. This means driving our propellers at 60 W for
three hours, which is not bad.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-touches">💅 Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>We still have tomake sure this thing is light enough to get in the
air, and then fly it.</p>
<h3 id="control">💻 Control</h3>
<p>Let’s start by how to fly it. The idea is to build an autonomous
drone, so it needs to have enough sensors to know where it is and what
it is doing. Also an onboard computer, and servos to move the control
surfaces: ailerons on wings and tail.</p>
<p>Today there is no wonder in getting a GPS, accelerometers, world-wide
communications, camera, microphone, plus a powerful computer into a
compact package weighing less than 0.25 kg. We call it “mobile phone”.
But we may need something like a Raspberry Pi with electric controls to
drive the servos. Ideally we should get something that does both
functions, something like a Raspberry Pi which might do both functions
since it has a 4G module.</p>
<p>We can spare 0.5 kg for the onboard computer while servos might take
0.2 kg at most.</p>
<h3 id="weight-budget">🧮 Weight Budget</h3>
<p>Let’s add up a few other weights: a carbon fiber gondola is required
to hold battery and onboard computer below the hull, and help compensate
the weight of the solar panels. It might weigh 0.5 kg. We also need some
cabling for 0.2 kg.</p>
<p>These are our total weights:</p>

</table>
<p>The budget seems feasible, and we even have 0.3 kg to spare. If
needed it can be filled with ballast.</p>
<h3 id="pieces">🧩 Pieces</h3>
<p>Most of the pieces are off-the-shelf. Some are custom made like the
outer shell; and custom carbon fiber panels are expensive. But luckily
these panels are mostly one shape. Joining them could be a challenge,
and will probably require custom carbon fiber and fiberglass
together.</p>
<p>Everything else seems doable by a reasonably well equipped workshop.
The gondola does not hold a lot of weight, so might be 3D printed.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-picture">🖼️ The Big Picture</h2>
<p>To finish this article let’s dig a bit deeper into the concept of a
perpetual flying machine.</p>
<h3 id="but-why">🤌 But Why?</h3>
<p>The first reason why we should do something is always: because it’s
fun! Having wild ideas and following their feasibility is always quite
entertaining. But it’s reasonable that you might, as I do, feel the need
to justify any effort beyond ideation with practical applications.</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna">the
first article</a> I have found a number of references to similar
projects; from <a
href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20040021326/downloads/20040021326.pdf">obscure
NASA projects from the 2000s</a> to <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/t44ypy/can_you_have_a_selfmaintaining_hydrogen/">random
posts on Reddit</a>. Let us see what applications they envision.</p>
<p>NASA commissioned a fascinating <a
href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20040021326/downloads/20040021326.pdf">study
in 2003</a>, a concept quite similar to the avis aeterna: an airship
supposed to stay aloft for months or years at an altitude of 18 km or
higher. The objectives stated are communications and wide area
surveillance. In particular it studies how to keep the airships hovering
to watch over the US coasts. The concept included fuel cells and an
electrolyzer for hydrogen generation. The study doesn’t ask the question
of where the water for the electrolyzer should come from, which is
intriguing due to the lack of humidity at such heights. It appears to
store water somewhere.</p>
<p>The EU has funded the <a
href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285602">MAAT project</a>, a
rather bizarre concept that includes a lighter-than-air platform. It is
intended for passenger transportation; although how it intends to keep
passengers alive at <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michele-Trancossi/publication/257333740_MAAT_CruiserFeeder_Project_Criticalities_and_Solution_Guidelines/links/5824bd2f08ae7ea5be77e475/MAAT-Cruiser-Feeder-Project-Criticalities-and-Solution-Guidelines.pdf">13
to 17 km</a> with solar power is not explained anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, user <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/t44ypy/can_you_have_a_selfmaintaining_hydrogen/">IsaacArthur</a>
proposes to “support some useful communications infrastructure”. And of
course there’s meteorological observation like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_balloon">high-altitude
balloons</a> do, although to reach high altitude the avis should have to
carry more hydrogen and less cargo.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-up">🫴 Scaling Up</h3>
<p>This scale model does not have any kind of hydrogen regeneration: it
simply does not fit. According to our calculations it doesn’t need it
either: surely something else will fail before gas runs out after a
million days.</p>
<p>A bigger model should have some kind of atmospheric water gathering,
from which it can generate hydrogen by electrolisis to replenish any
leaks. A 6-meter-long model will have a reference length (height and
width) of 3 meters, and we get a volume and area of:</p>
<pre><code>V ≈ 3 m × 3 m × 6 m / 2 = 27 m³
S ≈ 5 × 3 m × 3 m = 45 m²
W ≈ V × density ≈ 27 × 1.2 kg
W ≈ 30 kg.</code></pre>
<p>With these calculations we are back to gross approximations. Remember
that the volume of a spheroid is approximately the cube of its reference
length, and that the density is the difference between air and hydrogen,
a bit more than 1 kg per m³. With a weight of nearly 30 kg we can do
more useful things already.</p>
<p>The law of squares and cubes, or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">square-cube
law</a>, does funny things: a 5m reference length would be 10 meter
long, and weigh approximately</p>
<pre><code>W = V × d(air)
W ≈ 5 × 5 × 5 × 1.2 kg = 150 kg</code></pre>
<p>Now a usable payload of 10% would get us to 15 kg. These dimensions
would be a bit big for a bus.</p>
<p>We don’t have to stop dreaming here: a reference length of 10 meters
would take us to over a ton of weight. This kind of artifact might hold
a person, should anyone want to ride a dirigible for any reason. The
shell might be 10 mm thick. If hydrogen losses remain moderate it might
remain aloft for months on end given the right meteorological
conditions.</p>
<h3 id="max-speed">⚡ Max Speed</h3>
<p>What will be the top speed of the avis at any length? Let’s suppose
we can lay out half the top rectangle with solar cells that provide 300
W/m²; top surface <code>S(top)</code> and generated power <code>P</code>
would be:</p>
<pre><code>S(top) ≈ l × 2l / 2 = l²,
P ≈ 300 W/m² × S(top) ≈ 300 W/m² × l²,</code></pre>
<p>Given the drag equation we can find out the required power at speed
<code>v</code>:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ ½ ρ × v³ × C(D) × S,
S ≈ 5 × l²,
P ≈ ½ 1.3 kg/m³ × v³ × C(D) × 5 × l².</code></pre>
<p>Using the same drag coefficient as before of 0.03:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ ½ 1.3 kg/m³ × v³ × 0.03 × 5 × l²,
P ≈ 0.1 kg/m³ × l² × v³.</code></pre>
<p>Combining both equations for power <code>P</code>:</p>
<pre><code>300 W/m² × l² ≈ 0.1 kg/m³ × v³ × l²</code></pre>
<p>Therefore we can remove the terms <code>l²</code> from both sides,
and we get a constant equation for max speed <code>v</code> regardless
of model length:</p>
<pre><code>300 W/m² ≈ 0.1 kg/m³ × v³
v³ ≈ 300 W/m² / 0.1 kg/m³
v³ ≈ 3000 Wm/kg
v ≈ 14 m/s</code></pre>
<p>We get a <strong>top speed of nearly 15 m/s that doesn’t change with
scale</strong>. Keep in mind that this is in direct incident sunlight
without any inefficiencies, so very likely speed will be lower than this
unless there are major technological breakthroughs.</p>
<p>To remain stationary the avis needs a decent max speed to counter any
winds. No matter the size, the role of patrolling a given spot is only
possible if there are no constant winds in the area. Otherwise the avis
will have to navigate those winds by changing altitude or otherwise
finding favorable air currents.</p>
<p>But even with a slow top speed the avis may have other applications,
as long as it is not required to stay at exactly the same spot.</p>
<h3 id="changes">🔮 Changes</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna">last
article</a> I used a reference design 10 meters long and 10 meters wide.
That is definitely too large for an initial model. The proportions have
changed since then.</p>
<p>We have also abandoned the idea of using hydrogen as fuel instead of
using an electrical battery. The inefficiencies of converting energy to
hydrogen, and then hydrogen back to energy, are high. Also the need to
store the resulting water as intermediate product negates any weight
advantages.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<p>It should be possible to create a car-sized model of an avis aeterna,
to stay aloft for several days, demonstrating its major features.</p>
