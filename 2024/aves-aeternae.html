										<p>🛩️ Building Perpetual Flying Machines<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Last year I published an article about <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna">perpetual flying
machines</a>: flying machines that could stay aloft indefinitely. The
initial numbers were intriguing: the concept was viable. But nobody has
done it yet. Should we accept the challenge?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Plans for a model airship.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="building-models">🏗️ Building Models</h1>
<p>I set up to build more detailed plans with a given scale in mind. I
expected to find a wall at any point where the required technology just
wasn’t available, or it was too exotic to be purchased just yet. To my
surprise there were no showstoppers: the technology is here, and
everything seems to be feasible, right now. The engineering challenge is
thus amazingly possible.</p>
<h2 id="model-scale">🎚️ Model Scale</h2>
<p>So let’s build a scale model!</p>
<h3 id="shape">🏉 Shape</h3>
<p>Let’s first look at the shape. The classical design for a blimp or a
zeppelin is a spheroid. (Yes, I know that last time I chose a shape
similar to a boat: square and with flat profile. I have since come to
appreciate the classics.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/aves-ellipsoid.png"
title="3D rendering of an ellipsoid, a stretched sphere or the shape of a rugby ball."

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A spheroid or ellipsoid. Source: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ellipsoid_Quadric.png">Sam
Derbyshire, Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is quite aerodynamic, or should be: the drag coefficient of a
spheroid is between 0.02 and 0.04, according to <a
href="https://doi.org/10.2514/1.14796">GE Dorrington in “Drag of
Spheroid-Cone Shaped Airship”</a>. Also it is simple to model and build.
So let’s go with a spheroid!</p>
<h3 id="dimensions">📏 Dimensions</h3>
<p>An intriguing option is to size the avis aeterna vaguely like a car:
two meters wide and tall, four meters long. (For US readers: that is 6.5
feet wide and tall, 13 feet long.) These dimensions are big enough to be
substantial but small enough to be built in a garage with limited
means.</p>
<p>This decision mandates all of the proportions of the model: with the
value of 2 m and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid">spheroid</a> equations we
can compute everything else. First we have a prolate spheroid with axis
<code>A=2m</code>, and length <code>C=4m</code>. The volume contained
becomes:</p>
<p><code>V = πA²C/6 ≈ A²C/2,</code></p>
<p>which is a surprisingly accurate formula (actual factor above should
be 0.523). In our case:</p>
<p><code>V ≈ 2m × 2m × 4m / 2 = (2m)³ = 8 m³.</code></p>
<p>And the area is very approximately:</p>
<p><code>S ≈ 5 × 2m × 2m = 5 × 4m² = 20 m².</code></p>
<p>These are the basic parameters of our model.</p>
<h3 id="weight">⚖️ Weight</h3>
<p>You may remember that the plan was to fill the airship with hydrogen:
even lighter than helium, and quite cheaper. For an uncrewed vehicle the
risks are negligible. Also, for a continuously flying machine hydrogen
can be replenished in flight, as we will see later.</p>
<p>How much will our model weight? Exactly as much as the air displaced
by the hydrogen: we compute the weight of the air inside, and then
subtract the weight of the same volume of hydrogen. Since the density of
air is 1.3 kg/m³, and of hydrogen is 70 g/m³, lift will be:</p>
<p>`L = (1.3 - 0.070) kg/m³ × 8 m³ ≈ 9.84 kg.</p>
<p>So our weight budget is around 10 kg. As you see, at this stage it’s
not enough to do Fermi estimations (i.e. order of magnitude): for a
detailed feasibility study we need more precise numbers. It is still OK
to round up numbers as we did above with surface and volume.</p>
<h2 id="build">🛠️ Build</h2>
<p>How can we build a real life airship, even if it’s a small one?</p>
<h3 id="structure">🪚 Structure</h3>
<p>We want to build a dirigible: an airship which is sustented by the
lift of a light gas. In fact we want a rigid hull instead of an
inflatable structure. We know that dirigibles worked beautifully even
with ancient 1900s materials; is it possible to build one at this
scale?</p>
<p>Let’s go with the simplest structure: just a shell. We can set up a
rigid hull that contains a sack, which in turn holds our lifting gas.
What is the weight per square meter that we can afford?</p>
<p>First we have to set up a weight budget for this concept: how much of
our 10 kg we want to spend in the shell. It seems unavoidable that this
is going to be our biggest source of weight, and that we should reserve
as much for it as we can afford: a stronger structure is going to hold
up better against strong winds or impacts. Let us say half our weight is
for the structure.</p>
<p>We have to reserve some weight for the wings and other parts, leaving
perhaps 4 kg for the hull. Since we have 20 m² of surface, the areal
density will be:</p>
<pre><code>D(A) = 4 kg / 20 m²,
D(A) = 200 g/m².</code></pre>
<p>What kind of material can be strong enough at 0.2 kg per square
meter? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers">Carbon
fiber</a> should fit the bill. It is a very interesting material made of
carbon fibers embedded in an epoxy resin, which when cured results in
super strong panels.</p>
<h3 id="wings-and-reinforcements">🪽 Wings and Reinforcements</h3>
<p>We have set aside a budget of one kg for the rest of the hull.</p>
<p>The wings need also be built using carbon fiber. They need to be even
stronger than the outer shell. The two wings and the tail on top are of
the same approximate dimensions: 60 x 80 cm, for a total area of approx.
one third of a m². The three therefore share an area of 1 m². The areal
density needs to be at least twice of the shell, probably 500 g/m², for
a total weight of 0.5 kg.</p>
<p>Also some reinforcements are required where the parts are joined. It
is impossible to build the hull in one go; different pieces have to
built and assembled. In our case we can build eight identical panels,
which is quite convenient from the manufacturing point of view. Those
can then be assembled together using reinforcements, built using carbon
fiber and some glass fiber for elasticity.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/aves-aeternae-hull.png"
title="A spheroid cut in eight: seen from the top an ellipse cut in four pieces. Source: the author."
alt="Eight pieces of the hull: four on top, four below." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eight pieces of the hull: four on top,
four below.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally we need a small cone to place at the front. Together the
objective of 1 kg seems doable.</p>
<h3 id="hydrogen-sack">🎈 Hydrogen Sack</h3>
<p>Inside the hull a large bag will hold the gas. At this scale we don’t
want a complicated set of sacks containing the hydrogen; just one big
bag will do.</p>
<p>Helium balloons are usually done with Mylar, but there are materials
that leak even less hydrogen: PVA is a very strong contender. In <a
href="https://rest.neptune-prod.its.unimelb.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/9a2af3f4-a7c8-467a-ba32-ade91ba45822/content">“Internal
polymeric coating materials…”</a> Lei <em>et al</em> experiment with
several coatings, finding that PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) has the lowest
hydrogen permeability.</p>
<p>Luckily it is not hard to get PVA bags, as they are widely used in
industry because they are biodegradable. One precaution is that PVA
dissolves in water, so the interior of the structure must be kept
strictly dry.</p>
<p>Bags with thickness of 40 microns are quite common in the industry.
Given the density of PVA of 1.19 g/cm³, for our total surface of 20 m²
we get:</p>
<pre><code>W(bag) ≈ 0.040 mm × 1.19 g/cm³ × 20 m²
W(bag) ≈ 950 g ≈ 1 kg</code></pre>
<p>So another kg for our weight budget, for a total of 6 so far.</p>
<h3 id="hydrogen-leaks">💨 Hydrogen Leaks</h3>
<p>How much hydrogen would leak out of our PVA bag in a day? This of
course depends on how well sealed the bag is and the quality of the
materials. We can use a unit of permeability called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrer">Barrer</a> to quantify it.
Again in <a
href="https://rest.neptune-prod.its.unimelb.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/9a2af3f4-a7c8-467a-ba32-ade91ba45822/content">Lei
<em>et al</em>’s study</a> the permeability of PVA is given as 0.0084
barrer. Given the definition of 1 barrer in SI units:</p>
<p><code>1 barrer = 3.35 × 10^-16 × mol × m / (m² × s × Pa),</code></p>
<p>the formula for leaked gas is a bit messy, so bear with me. Leaked
quantity can be computed as follows:</p>
<p><code>Quantity = permeability × surface × time × pressure / thickness.</code></p>
<p>We computed a total <code>surface</code> of 20 m², which also holds
for the internal bag. We want to find out the leaked quantity for a day
so <code>time</code> will be 86400 seconds. The <code>pressure</code>
differential will be of atmospheric pressure or 101325 Pascal, assuming
that the external hydrogen pressure is nil and pressure inside the bag
will not be much higher than 1 atm; even <a
href="https://www.mwmresearchgroup.org/the-science-of-balloons-part-2.html">small
balloons</a> are only a few percent tighter than atmospheric
pressure.</p>
<p>Finally let’s recall that we are using a 40 micron bag. Now we have
everything we need to compute the daily leaked quantity
<code>Q</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Q ≈ 0.0084 barrer × 20 m² × 86400 s × 101325 Pa / 0.000040 m,
Q ≈ 0.0084 × 3.35 × 10^-16 mol × 86400 × 101325 / 0.00004,
Q ≈ 0.0006 mol.</code></pre>
<p>Converting to grams is easy as 1 mol of Hydrogen is defined as 1 g,
so we are leaking a bit more than half a milligram per day. Not bad
considering that we have around 0.5 kg of hydrogen! We might stay aloft
for a million days at this rate. These numbers do not look very
realistic, and have to be contrasted with real world tests with real
bags. In any case the safety margin should be enough to stay in the air
for days or even weeks.</p>
<h2 id="energy-sources">⚡ Energy Sources</h2>
<p>The airship needs to be able to direct its flight. It needs a power
source that gives enough energy for our purposes. Being a demonstration
model it doesn’t need to withstand any kind of weather, but it needs to
manouver at a certain speed.</p>
<h3 id="power">🛩️ Power</h3>
<p>How much power do we need? Let’s recall the drag equation:</p>
<p><code>F(D) = ½ ρ × v² × C(D) × S(front),</code></p>
<p>where the surface will now be the front area which is a circle of
radius 1m,</p>
<pre><code>S(front) = π × l²/4,
S(front) ≈ 3 m².</code></pre>
<p>Power is just force multiplied by velocity, so we just multiply this
force again by the velocity:</p>
<pre><code>P = F(D) × v,
P = ½ ρ × v³ × C(D) × S(front).</code></pre>
<p>So the power we need to move at a given velocity can be computed
using the front surface of 3 m², the density of air of 1.3 kg/m³, and
the average drag coefficient we saw above for a spheroid with a cone of
<code>0.03</code>. (Note: carbon fiber is a very polished surface so the
drag coefficient might be even lower.)</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ ½ 1.3 kg/m³ × 0.03 × 3 m² × v³,
P ≈ 0.06 kg/m × v³.</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s set as target speed a leisurely pace of 10 m/s, or 36 km/h
(22 mph). Our avis aeterna is not going to be a speed demon, but it will
move about. The required power will be:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ 0.06 × 10³ kg×m²/s³ ≈ 60 W.</code></pre>
<p>Approximately <strong>60 watt of power are needed to move at 10
m/s</strong>. Is this possible to achieve?</p>
<h3 id="motor-and-propeller">⚙️ Motor and Propeller</h3>
<p>From this power target we have to discount the efficiency of motor
and propeller. Luckily thanks to the RC industry there are a lot of very
efficient motors (brushless and sensored are apparently the way to go)
and propellers which are powerful and light enough.</p>
<p>There is at least a 20% reduction in efficiency due to the
combination of motor and propeller to be taken into account. So our 60 W
of impulse become at least 70 W at generation. Another important
consideration is that the weight of two motors and two propellers should
be well below 500 g.</p>
<p>For balance the propellers should be one at each side of the airship;
this will also allow it to maneuver using differential power. They
should also be near the forward of the ship to avoid instabilities.</p>
<h3 id="solar-energy">☀️ Solar Energy</h3>
<p>Where can we take our power from? If we want our avis to stay in the
air indefinitely we cannot depend on carrying fuel aboard as it would be
exhausted at some point. There are not many renewable sources of energy
up in the air. The most obvious is the Sun: embed some solar panels on
top of our hull and we are good to go!</p>
<p>Ultralight panels are not easy to find. But there are companies
commercializing powerful panels today. One such example is the <a
href="https://www.solbian.eu/en/sp-series/26-sp-24.html">Solbian SP
24</a>, which provides a nominal 82 W with a weight of 1.1 kg.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that solar panels tend to provide less power than
advertised even in full sunlight. So it is possible that at midday in
optimal weather in a temperate country this panel might get to give us
the 70 W we need. We might use a couple of these panels to reach more
power, but then the airship may become top-heavy and destabilize.</p>
<p>It is not unusual to see promises of much more powerful solar cells.
<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/ultrathin-solar-cells-1209">MIT
researchers</a> were announcing 370 W/kg in 2022, which would be closer
to what we need. And the Airbus Zephyr uses Microlink solar sheets <a
href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microlink-devices-powers-successful-stratospheric-flight-of-airbus-defence-and-space-zephyr-s-haps-solar-aircraft-300732214.html">exceeding
1500 W/kg and 350 W/m²</a> apparently, or so they say.</p>
<p>We might even get to 20 m/s with this kind of power. But keep in mind
that the cubed equation we got above for power is quite treacherous: to
double our initial 10 m/s we would need 8 times more power, or 560 W. We
will explore theoretical max velocity below. For now we will keep to our
target speed.</p>
<h3 id="wind-energy">🌬️ Wind Energy</h3>
<p>An intriguing possibility which does not require any technological
leaps of faith is to use wind energy.</p>
<p>But wait, how can you use wind energy to propel yourself if you are
moving in the wind? It’s the same principle as regenerative braking in
electric cars: you let the motor spin freely. Instead of spending energy
to move the wheels, the movement of the wheels charges the battery. Same
principle: Yokota and Fujimoto investigated the principle in planes in
<a
href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejjia/11/2/11_21005706/_pdf">Pitch
Angle Control by Regenerative Air Brake for Electric Aircraft</a>, and
it is perfectly possible if the wings are oriented correctly. It even
decelerates the aircraft, which is to be expected since the energy is
taken from the flowing air.</p>
<p>So the idea would be: orient the airship so the propellers move
maximally, stop the motor and let it charge the batteries. The craft
would slow down at the same time so it would not be carried away by the
wind so fast. Then, once the batteries are charged we can start the
propellers and move back to the desired position. This process can be
repeated as often as desired; of course it will not be very efficient
but might help not drift away too much whenever other power sources are
not available, e.g. at night.</p>
<h3 id="batteries">🔋 Batteries</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, is there any of that weight budget left at this
point for the batteries? They can be used to store some of the solar and
wind energy during the day, and use it at night to avoid drifting
away.</p>
<p>We will have to set aside at least 1 kg for a good battery. We can
get <a
href="https://www.jinbei-deutschland.de/en/products/v-mount-battery-180-wh-28309">180
Wh commercially</a> today. This means driving our propellers at 60 W for
three hours, which is not bad, supposing we can charge it while there is
sunlight.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-touches">💅 Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>We still have to make sure this thing is light enough to get in the
air, and then fly it.</p>
<h3 id="control">💻 Control</h3>
<p>Let’s start by how to fly it. An autonomous drone needs to have
enough sensors to know where it is and what it is doing. Also an onboard
computer and servos to move the control surfaces: ailerons on wings and
tail.</p>
<p>Today it is not hard to get a powerful computer with GPS,
accelerometers, camera, microphone, plus world-wide communications, into
a compact package weighing less than 0.25 kg. We call it “mobile phone”.
Also we may need something like a Raspberry Pi with electric controls to
drive the servos. Ideally we should get something that does both
functions, but we can equip both if necessary.</p>
<p>We can spare 0.5 kg for the onboard computer(s) while servos should
take 0.2 kg at most.</p>
<h3 id="weight-budget">🧮 Weight Budget</h3>
<p>Let’s add up a few other weights: a strong gondola is required to
hold battery and onboard computer below the hull, so it can help
compensate the weight of the solar panels on top. It might weigh 0.5 kg.
We also need some cables for which we will reserve 0.2 kg.</p>
<p>These are our total weights:</p>

</table>
<p>The budget seems feasible, and we even have 140 grams to spare. If
needed it can be filled with ballast.</p>
<h3 id="pieces">🧩 Pieces</h3>
<p>Most of the pieces are off-the-shelf. Some are custom made like the
outer shell; and custom carbon fiber panels are expensive. But luckily
these panels are mostly one shape. Joining them could be a challenge,
and will probably require custom carbon fiber and fiberglass
together.</p>
<p>Everything else seems doable by a reasonably well equipped workshop.
The gondola does not hold a lot of weight, so might be 3D printed.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-picture">🖼️ The Big Picture</h2>
<p>To finish this article let’s dig a bit deeper into the concept of a
perpetual flying machine.</p>
<h3 id="but-why">🤌 But Why?</h3>
<p>The first reason why we should do something is always: because it’s
fun! Having wild ideas and following their feasibility is always quite
entertaining. But it’s reasonable that you might, as I do, feel the need
to justify any effort beyond ideation with practical applications.</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna">the
first article</a> I have found a number of references to similar
projects; from <a
href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20040021326/downloads/20040021326.pdf">obscure
NASA projects from the 2000s</a> to <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/t44ypy/can_you_have_a_selfmaintaining_hydrogen/">random
posts on Reddit</a>. Let us see what applications they envision.</p>
<p>NASA commissioned a fascinating <a
href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20040021326/downloads/20040021326.pdf">study
in 2003</a>, a concept quite similar to the avis aeterna: an airship
supposed to stay aloft for months or years at an altitude of 18 km or
higher. The objectives stated are communications and wide area
surveillance. In particular it studies how to keep the airships hovering
to watch over the US coasts. The concept included fuel cells and an
electrolyzer for hydrogen generation. The study doesn’t ask the question
of where the water for the electrolyzer should come from, which is
intriguing due to the lack of humidity at such heights. It appears to
store water somewhere.</p>
<p>The EU has funded the <a
href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285602">MAAT project</a>, a
rather bizarre concept that includes a lighter-than-air platform. It is
intended for passenger transportation; although how it intends to keep
passengers alive at <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michele-Trancossi/publication/257333740_MAAT_CruiserFeeder_Project_Criticalities_and_Solution_Guidelines/links/5824bd2f08ae7ea5be77e475/MAAT-Cruiser-Feeder-Project-Criticalities-and-Solution-Guidelines.pdf">13
to 17 km</a> with solar power is not explained anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, user <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IsaacArthur/comments/t44ypy/can_you_have_a_selfmaintaining_hydrogen/">IsaacArthur</a>
proposes to “support some useful communications infrastructure”. And of
course there’s meteorological observation like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_balloon">high-altitude
balloons</a> do, although to reach high altitude the avis should have to
carry more hydrogen and less cargo.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-up">🫴 Scaling Up</h3>
<p>This scale model does not have any kind of hydrogen regeneration: it
simply does not fit. According to our calculations it doesn’t need it
either: surely something else will fail before gas runs out after a
million days.</p>
<p>A bigger model should have some kind of atmospheric water gathering,
from which it can generate hydrogen by electrolisis to replenish any
leaks. A 6-meter-long model will have a height and width of 3 meters,
and we get a volume and area of:</p>
<pre><code>V ≈ 3 m × 3 m × 6 m / 2 = 27 m³,
S ≈ 5 × 3 m × 3 m = 45 m²,
W ≈ V × density ≈ 27 × 1.2 kg,
W ≈ 30 kg.</code></pre>
<p>In general, given reference length (height and width)
<code>l</code>:</p>
<pre><code>V ≈ l³,
S ≈ 5 l²,
W ≈ 1.2 kg/m³ × l³.</code></pre>
<p>With these calculations we are back to gross approximations. Remember
that the volume of a spheroid is approximately the cube of its reference
length, and that the density is the difference between air and hydrogen,
a bit more than 1 kg per m³. With a weight of nearly 30 kg we can do
more useful things already.</p>
<p>The law of squares and cubes, or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">square-cube
law</a>, does funny things: a 5m reference length would be 10 meter
long, and weigh approximately</p>
<pre><code>W = V × d(air)
W ≈ 5 × 5 × 5 × 1.2 kg = 150 kg</code></pre>
<p>Now a usable payload of 10% would get us to 15 kg. These dimensions
would be a bit big for a bus.</p>
<p>We don’t have to stop dreaming here: a reference length of 10 meters
would take us to over a ton of weight. This kind of artifact might hold
a person, should anyone want to ride a dirigible for any reason. The
shell might be 10 mm thick. If hydrogen losses remain moderate it might
remain aloft for months on end given the right meteorological
conditions.</p>
<h3 id="max-speed">⚡ Max Speed</h3>
<p>What will be the top speed of the avis at any length? Let’s suppose
we can lay out half the top rectangle with solar cells that provide 300
W/m², and that are light enough not to tip the avis upside down. This is
currently the state of the art. Given reference length <code>l</code>,
top surface <code>S(top)</code> and generated power <code>P</code> would
be:</p>
<pre><code>S(top) ≈ l × 2l / 2 = l²,
P ≈ 300 W/m² × S(top) ≈ 300 W/m² × l²,</code></pre>
<p>This equation yields a max power of 1200 W for our usual model length
of 2 m. Given the drag equation we can find out the required power at
speed <code>v</code>, using the front area and the same drag coefficient
as before of 0.03:</p>
<pre><code>P ≈ ½ ρ × v³ × C(D) × S(front),
S(front) = π × l²/4,
P ≈ ½ 1.3 kg/m³ × v³ × 0.03 × π × l²/4,
P ≈ 0.015 kg/m³ × l² × v³.</code></pre>
<p>Combining both equations for power <code>P</code>:</p>
<pre><code>300 W/m² × l² ≈ 0.015 kg/m³ × v³ × l²</code></pre>
<p>Therefore we can remove the terms <code>l²</code> from both sides,
and we get a constant equation for max speed <code>v</code> regardless
of model length:</p>
<pre><code>300 W/m² ≈ 0.015 kg/m³ × v³
v³ ≈ 300 W/m² / 0.015 kg/m³
v³ ≈ 20000 Wm/kg
v ≈ 27 m/s</code></pre>
<p>We get a <strong>top speed of nearly 30 m/s that doesn’t change with
scale</strong>. Keep in mind that this is in direct incident sunlight
without any inefficiencies, so very likely max speed will be lower than
this unless there are major technological breakthroughs. Also we will
need some of that power to charge the batteries for the night.</p>
<p>To remain stationary the avis needs a decent <strong>average</strong>
speed to counter any winds. No matter the size, the role of patrolling a
given spot is only possible if there are no constant winds in the area.
Otherwise the avis will have to navigate those winds by changing
altitude or otherwise finding favorable thermal air currents.</p>
<p>But even with a slower average speed the avis may have other
applications, as long as it is not required to stay at exactly the same
spot.</p>
<h3 id="changes">🔮 Changes</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna">last
article</a> I used a reference design 10 meters long and 10 meters wide.
That is definitely too large for an initial model. The proportions have
changed since then.</p>
<p>We have also abandoned the idea of using hydrogen as fuel instead of
using an electrical battery. The inefficiencies of converting energy to
hydrogen, and then hydrogen back to energy, are high. Also the need to
store the resulting water as intermediate product negates any weight
advantages.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<p>It should be possible to create a car-sized model of an avis aeterna,
to stay aloft for several days, demonstrating its major features.</p>
