Last year I published an article about [perpetual flying machines](https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna):
flying machines that could stay aloft indefinitely.
The initial numbers were intriguing: the concept was viable.
But nobody has done it yet.
Should we accept the challenge?

# 🏗️ Building Models

I set up to build more detailed plans with a given scale in mind.
I expected to find a wall at any point where the required technology just wasn't available,
or it was too exotic to be purchased just yet.
To my surprise there were no showstoppers:
the technology is here,
and everything seems to be feasible, right now.
The engineering challenge is thus amazingly possible.

## 🎈 Model Scale

What would be an appropriate scale for a model?

### 🏉 Proportions

The classical design for a blimp or a zeppelin is a spheroid.
(Yes, I know that last time I chose a design similar to a boat:
square and flat profile.
I have since come to appreciate a more classic dirigible design.)

### 📏 Dimensions

An intriguing option is to size the avis aeterna vaguely like a car:
two meters wide and tall, four meters long.
(For any US readers it's 6.5 feet wide.)
It is big enough to be substantial,
but small enough to be built in a garage.

This mandates all of the proportions of the model:
with the value of two meters and the [spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid)
equations we can compute everything else.
First we have a prolate spheroid with axis `A=2m`,
and length `C=4m`.
The volume contained becomes:

`V = πA²C/6 ≈ A²C/2,`

which is a surprisingly accurate formula
(actual factor above should be 0.523).
In our case:

`V ≈ 2m * 2m * 4m / 2 = (2m)³ = 8 m³.`

And the area is very approximately:

`S ≈ 5 * 2m * 2m = 5 * 4m² = 20 m².`

### 🏋️ Weight

How much will our model weight?
Exactly as much as the air displaced by the hydrogen:
we compute the weight of the air inside,
and then subtract the weight of the same volume of hydrogen.
Since the density of air is 1.3 kg/m³,
and of hydrogen is 70 g/m³, lift will be:

`L = (1.3 - 0.070) kg/m³ * 8 m³ ≈ 9.84 kg.

So our budget is around 10 kg.
As you see, at this stage it's not enough to do Fermi estimations:
for a more detailed feasibility study we need more approximate numbers.
It is still OK to round up numbers as we did above with surface and volume.

## 🔮 Changes

In the [last article](https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna)
I used a reference design 10 meters long and 10 meters wide.
That is definitely too large for an initial model.
Also, the proportions have changed since then.
