Last year I published an article about [perpetual flying machines](https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna):
flying machines that could stay aloft indefinitely.
The initial numbers were intriguing: the concept was viable.
But nobody has done it yet.
Should we accept the challenge?

# 🏗️ Building Models

I set up to build more detailed plans with a given scale in mind.
I expected to find a wall at any point where the required technology just wasn't available,
or it was too exotic to be purchased just yet.
To my surprise there were no showstoppers:
the technology is here,
and everything seems to be feasible, right now.
The engineering challenge is thus amazingly possible.

## 📏 Model Scale

What would be an appropriate scale for a model?
An intriguing

### 🏉 Proportions

The classical design for a blimp or a zeppelin is a spheroid.

## 🔋 Energy Sources

## ⚖️ Weights



### 🛩️ Power

## 🔮 Changes

In the [last article](https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna)
I used a reference design 10 meters long and 10 meters wide.
That is definitely too large for an initial model.
Also, the proportions have changed since then.

The previous design was akin to a boat:
square and flat profile.
I have since come to appreciate a more classic dirigible design,
in the shape of a spheroid.
