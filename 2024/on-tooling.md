During my bumpy career as CTO and manager I have often struggled to make the case for better developer tooling.
For me it was a no-brainer:
paying developers a good chunk of money to do the same change 10 times over in different places,
or to wait for automated tests to finish,
seems like a huge waste.

Some big tech companies (Google and Meta come to mind)
have the best internal tooling, period;
this is in large part what enables them to be ahead of the competition.
And Joel Spolsky, creator of StackOverflow and Trello,
features tooling in several of the points of his legendary
[Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/),
used to evaluate the quality of a software team.
Specifically point 9 in the list says:

> Do you use the best tools money can buy?

I have focused on improving internal tooling whenever I had the chance,
even devoting some people full time to the task.
But I have often failed to show the value of this investment to (other) company founders:
having devs not work on features is what they really found wasteful.
After all, product features are seen as value;
while internal tooling is at best a necessary evil.

# üí∞ The Value of Tools

In many professional areas there are almost religious wars about tooling.
This is even more pronounced in software development,
where the arguments between e.g. proponents of the vim and Emacs text editors have been raging on for years.
And they are probably more than justified.

Our starting point is that the value of the work performed by a professional
is augmented by the tools they use.
A farmer that has to pick potatoes one by one will be 10 times more productive when they use a potato collector,
and again 10 times more when done with a tractor.
The value of their work goes up accordingly.

This is, simply put, why the industrial revolution raised the living standards of people.
When an employee manufactures 10 times more screws the employer has the potential to pay more,
and then this person can go out and spend that money in more valuable goods.
It is true that employers tend to want to keep money for themselves as profit.
But the knowledge required to operate complex machinery also grows,
which is a barrier of entry for other potential employees.

## Compound Value

The second derivative is that more productive employers have more money to invest in factory tooling.
As time goes by the quality of tools goes up,
which in turn enables the next cycle of investments
With better tools tolerances and clearances will go down,
which means that the machines built can be more useful.
Precision engineering has allowed us to have millimeter-thick screws
and supersonic airplanes and computers.

Oh, let me tell you about general purpose computers.
In a sense they are the ultimate productivity tools:
they can run random programs to do any tasks and can also be augmented with custom software.
Computers can also drive lots of different hardware,
from weather sensors to industrial printers.

Computers can indeed control entire production lines.
Now we are not only speaking about increasing productivity for one worker,
but optimizing entire factories.
The value of good tools compounds over time.

## üèí Exponential Value

Can this process of increasing value accelerate even more?
Have we found the _perpetuum mobile_ of productivity?
Well, up to a point.

Compound interest leads to exponential savings.
We have to assume that there is some limit somewhere:
at some point we cannot optimize a process any longer.
The old dream of a single person running a fully automated factory is still not possible,
and production is just a single aspect of a company.
But when we move to the software industry this limit is even further away.
Companies like Google and Amazon showed us that one sysadmin could first herd a bunch of servers,
then a rack and at some point a whole datacenter.

In my mind, the whole point of software startups, hockey-stick exponential curves and hypergrowth
is precisely that we are building better tools -- for other people or for ourselves.

# üí∞ Taking Care of Tooling

But we cannot disregard internal tooling;
after all it's what makes us productive when building the next generation of tools.

## Good Professionals

There's the old adage of "good professionals do good work even with crappy tools".
Sure, just like in the awesome scene from the movie [Rush (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(2013_film)),
Niki Lauda can run really fast in a Lancia Flavia 2000;
but he will not be winning any F1 championships any time soon in that tin can.

Would you ask a good butcher to slice a lamb leg with a butter knife?
Just as well you might ask a developer to write a web application in a very low-level programming language, like assembler.
In my experience good professionals can recognize and make good use of the best tools;
and they take care of their tooling.

## ü¶æ Building Tools

## Tools that Improve Themselves

The ultimate tool that we have is language.
But not everyone uses language the same way.

## Dog Fooding

## Code as Tooling

As my friend Luis Medel so carefully explains in his excellent Spanish article
["La martingala del software"](https://luismedel.com/palabras/la-martingala-del-software/),
software is a tool in itself.
And just as any language,
it is a tool that can operate on itself.

# ü§î Conclusion

Tooling is the ultimate investment for a company.
If you want to differentiate yourself from the competition start with having better tools.
