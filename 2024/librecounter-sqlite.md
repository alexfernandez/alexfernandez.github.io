# Data Migration

# Data

250884 increments in 111 seconds, 2264 incs/second
2031609 upserts in 111 seconds, 18331 ups/second

1293 domains overall, after cleaning up a bit there are around 300

# 🤔 Conclusion

Tooling is the ultimate investment for a company.
If you want to differentiate yourself from the competition start with having the best possible tools.
This includes any software required, either purchased or created internally,
and streamlining the workflow as much as possible.
Features will come easily after that.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

I have spoken about tooling with many developers.
Thanks to Luis Medel for the inspiration in his great article.
