![Climate change is here. [Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Change_in_Average_Temperature_With_Fahrenheit.svg).](pics/climate-change-temperatures.svg "Temperatures are rising already. World map comparing average temperatures 1956-1976 with 2011-2021 and going with the lower intervals: -0.5C in a small portion of the Anctartic, 0 in the South seas and near Iceland, +0.2 in 1/3 of the oceans, +0.5 in most of the remaining oceans, +1 in most land areas, +2 in the Arctic.")

The world is overheating.
