The world is overheating.
This is not opinion, this is a fact that can be measured by satellites.
But you don't need high tech:
in fact it can be verified by any people with
[thermometers and old notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record).

# üå°Ô∏è Is It Real?

What can we do about it, and should we do anything?
First we would have to agree on the causes,
and as you may know there is a huge debate in our polarized society.
Not in scientific circles though.
Almost 40 years ago I read "Asimov's Guide to Science" by the great Isaac Asimov.
When speaking about the atmosphere he had these words:

> Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation rather strongly. This means that when there are appreciable amounts of it in the atmosphere, it tends to block the escape of heat at night from the sun-warmed earth. The result is that heat accumulates. On the other hand, when the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere falls, the earth steadily cools.

> If the current concentration of carbon dioxide in the air should double (from 0.03 per cent of the air to 0.06 per cent) that small change would suffice to raise the earth‚Äôs over-all temperature by three degrees and would bring about the complete and quick melting of the continental glaciers. If the carbon dioxide dropped to half the present amount, the temperature would drop sufficiently to bring the glaciers down to New York City again.

> Whatever the cause of the ice ages may have been, it seems now that man himself may be changing the climate in store for the future. The American physicist Gilbert N. Plass has suggested that we may be seeing the last of the ice ages, because the furnaces of civilization are loading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. A hundred million chimneys are ceaselessly pouring carbon dioxide into the air; the total amount is about six billion tons a year 200 times the quantity coming from volcanoes. Plass pointed out that since 1900 the carbon dioxide content of our atmosphere has increased about 10 per cent. This addition to the earth‚Äôs ‚Äúgreenhouse‚Äù shield against the escape of heat, he calculated, should raise the average temperature by about 1.1 degrees C. per century. During the first half of the twentieth century the average temperature has indeed risen at this rate [...]

I am quoting from the [1960 edition](https://archive.org/details/intelligentmansg0000unse/page/120/mode/2up),
so human-caused global warming is not a new theory invented by George Soros;
it is just a trivial extrapolation.
If we look at the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as measured in the Mauna Loa observatory,
far from all sources of industrial contamination,
the trend could not be more worrying.

![Atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ has been rising steadily since before 1960; the rate is accelerating. [Source](https://gml.noaa.gov/obop/mlo/programs/esrl/co2/co2.html).](pics/climate-change-dioxide.gif "Data from the Mauna Loa Observatory: concentration in parts per million was ~310 in 1960, ~340 in 1985 and ~380 in 2010.")

It is highly likely that lowering CO‚ÇÇ would help alleviate global warming
and other effects of climate change.
So let us see if we humans can do something about it
using some engineering and a great deal of ingenuity.

# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Some Solutions

Right now there is no single solution to climate change,
and probably we will have to use many of them if we are to survive our own trap.

Now, before we start, let's be clear.
The first measure to mitigate climate change should be to **stop burning stuff**;
otherwise everything we do will be in vain.
But even if we stopped tomorrow and switched to 100% green energy
(a mix of solar, wind, hydro and nuclear)
there's the little matter of what we do with all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

We will review some solutions that can be found in the literature,
and even some of my own,
ranking them from more pedestrian to wildly out there.
We will try to understand how much they help,
and also if they have any side effects.

## üéöÔ∏è Fermi Estimation

To gauge the impact of each solution we will use a method attributed to Enrico Fermi:
[Fermi estimation](https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/).
The great physicist said that he could estimate any physical problem in a napkin by a factor of one order of magnitude,
that is: his answer would not be exact but should be between 10 times and one tenth of the correct solution.
It is legendary his measurement of the energy of the first atomic bomb by dropping pieces of paper
as it detonated and measuring their displacement in the air.

We will try to do the same with the ideas below to see if they would help.
We don't need complicated climate models to get a rough idea;
even if we are off by 100% we will know if our solution should more or less work.
Of course, we should go with the complicated models before investing real money in the idea.

The method as we will apply it is simply to take an approximate estimation for each value,
within an order of magnitude (between 10 times and 1/10th),
and combine them in simple ways (basically addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
The solution will tend to the real value as long as errors are more or less distributed uniformly,
i.e. sometimes we are above, some times we are below.

## üå≤ Lots of Trees

The first solution can be a bit disappointing:
planting lots of trees.
I am sure you were looking for clever carbon-capture devices
that could turn the tide and suck all that carbon out of the skies,
using modern technology.
Problem is, none of it works properly.

Meanwhile Mother Nature has created these wonderful machines,
that have adapted during millions of years to do basically one thing:
convert CO‚ÇÇ to carbon in their trunks.
In the process they also generate sugars, create seeds and deter hungry animals,
but these are secondary interests.

Another very interesting possibility is using algae,
which are more efficient because they already have all the water necessary in their surroundings.
The techniques are more difficult to implement than just planting trees.
Also, if 

### Efficiency

### Side Effects

The side effects of planting a lot of trees are generally very nice:
having a lot of trees.
They cool the surroundings,
help fixate the ground and provide a living environment for other creatures.
In cities they lower the temperature of a street by at least five degrees in summer.

There's the matter of albedo (or proportion of sunlight reflected):
trees are generally darker than rock,
and therefore can negate some of the benefits of carbon capture by absorbing heat.
But this is a 

Also, what do we do with all that carbon once it is stored in trees?
If we just leave them there then there is a limit to the carbon taken from the atmosphere.
This solution might be potentially even more efficient if we somehow mowed down trees from time to time and disposed of them,
for example by burying them or throwing them into the sea.
