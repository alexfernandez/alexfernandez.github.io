The world is overheating.
This is not opinion, this is a fact that can be measured by satellites.
But you don't need high tech:
in fact it can be verified by any people with
[thermometers and old notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record).

# üå°Ô∏è Is It Real?

What can we do about it, and should we do anything?
First we would have to agree on the causes,
and as you may know there is a huge debate in our polarized society.
Not in scientific circles though.
Almost 40 years ago I read "Asimov's Guide to Science" by the great Isaac Asimov.
When speaking about the atmosphere he had these words:

> Carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation rather strongly. This means that when there are appreciable amounts of it in the atmosphere, it tends to block the escape of heat at night from the sun-warmed earth. The result is that heat accumulates. On the other hand, when the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere falls, the earth steadily cools.

> If the current concentration of carbon dioxide in the air should double (from 0.03 per cent of the air to 0.06 per cent) that small change would suffice to raise the earth‚Äôs over-all temperature by three degrees and would bring about the complete and quick melting of the continental glaciers. If the carbon dioxide dropped to half the present amount, the temperature would drop sufficiently to bring the glaciers down to New York City again.

> Whatever the cause of the ice ages may have been, it seems now that man himself may be changing the climate in store for the future. The American physicist Gilbert N. Plass has suggested that we may be seeing the last of the ice ages, because the furnaces of civilization are loading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. A hundred million chimneys are ceaselessly pouring carbon dioxide into the air; the total amount is about six billion tons a year 200 times the quantity coming from volcanoes. Plass pointed out that since 1900 the carbon dioxide content of our atmosphere has increased about 10 per cent. This addition to the earth‚Äôs ‚Äúgreenhouse‚Äù shield against the escape of heat, he calculated, should raise the average temperature by about 1.1 degrees C. per century. During the first half of the twentieth century the average temperature has indeed risen at this rate [...]

I am quoting from the [1960 edition](https://archive.org/details/intelligentmansg0000unse/page/120/mode/2up),
so human-caused global warming is not a new theory invented by George Soros;
it is just a trivial extrapolation.
If we look at the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as measured in the Mauna Loa observatory,
far from all sources of industrial contamination,
the trend could not be more worrying.

![Atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ has been rising steadily since before 1960; the rate is accelerating. [Source](https://gml.noaa.gov/obop/mlo/programs/esrl/co2/co2.html).](pics/climate-change-dioxide.gif "Data from the Mauna Loa Observatory: concentration in parts per million was ~310 in 1960, ~340 in 1985 and ~380 in 2010.")

It is highly likely that lowering CO‚ÇÇ would help alleviate global warming
and other effects of climate change.
So let us see if we humans can do something about it
using some engineering and a great deal of ingenuity.

# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Some Solutions

We will review some solutions that can be found in the literature,
and even some of my own,
ranking them from more pedestrian to wildly out there.

## üéöÔ∏è Fermi Estimation

To gauge the impact of each solution we will use a method attributed to Enrico Fermi:
[Fermi estimation](https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/).
The great physicist said that he could estimate any physical problem in a napkin by a factor of magnitude,
that is: his answer would not be exact but should be between 10 and 1/10 of the correct solution.
It is legendary his measurement of the energy of the first atomic bomb by dropping pieces of paper
as it detonated and measuring their displacement in the air.

We will try to do the same here.

## üå≤ Lots of Trees

The first solution can be a bit disappointing:
planting lots of trees.
I am sure you were looking for clever carbon-capture devices
that could turn the tide and suck all that CO‚ÇÇ right out of the skies,
using modern technology.
Problem is, none of it works properly.

Meanwhile Nature has created these wonderful

## ü§î Conclusion

It is possible to fix the planet, but not easy.

I have learned a lot speaking about these issues with many friends,
including Juan Villamizar y Juan Searle.
