Software architecture is a fun beast:
it is as much driven by fashion as by sane reasoning.
When client-server architectures were in fashion during the 90s,
everyone built systems separating client and server,
often when the separation really made no sense.
Then a few years later three-tier architectures were all the rage,
and everything had to have a database inserted somewhere,
even when a few files would have sufficed.
Not to mention architectural fads such as the Enterprise Service Bus
or Business Process Managers,
which have converted endless projects into unholy messes.

It's always a fun exercise to try to gaze into these trends and find the underlying models that drive them.
Today we will center on databases: what are they, and why do they exist?

# Information and Entropy

First let us take a small detour through Physics,
and more specifically Thermodynamics.
Don't worry, the author is a licensed practitioner of the discipline,
so even after having forgotten most of what I studied
you will get none of that "entropy is disorder" nonsense
that plagues today's divulgation articles.

## Entropy and Reversibility

It is true that classical entropy is particularly hard to imagine,
and that statistical thermodynamics only made it marginally easier.
But there is one lucky entry point which we can use to penetrate
the conceptual fortress: reversible processes.

A reversible process is, simply put, one which can be reverted in time.
By definition it has minimal entropy.
So, if we want to avoid entropy,
we just have to keep close to reversibility.

## Entropy as information

As [James Gleick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p51_qWPsTOA)
so eloquently puts it,
entropy is nothing else than information.
Not _negative_ information, a sentence designed to muddle your thoughts;
entropy is jut plain old information.
(You can do far worse than to read [his book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information:_A_History,_a_Theory,_a_Flood),
by the way.)

To the point that John Wheeler famously announced that
the whole universe was built on information,
summarized in the aphorism
["It from bit"](http://authors.library.caltech.edu/15184/1/Misner2009p1638Phys_Today.pdf).

## Back to Computing

So, how can we build a reversible information processing engine?

# Releasing Information

So, having established that information is entropy,
we can now get some valuable insights into the role of the database.
