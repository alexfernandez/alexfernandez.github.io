As reasonable people we dislike contradiction:
it is one of the telltale marks of the cheating kid,
of the dishonest politician,
and of the feeble mind.
However it is not easy to escape from its claws,
and whatever we do to dispel it,
it seems to come back to bite us in the ankles.

In this article we begin a study in this intriguing subject.
Perhaps you think you already know what contradiction is;
let's deconstruct that belief.

## So, What Is a Contradiction?

In the field of logic there is a beautiful definition:

> A contradiction means asserting a statement and its contrary.

For instance, if I say that "it is one o'clock" and "it is not one o'clock" at the same time,
I am immersed in a contradiction that needs to be solved one way or the other.

Note that in this very simple example we are presupposing that there is one authentic immutable truth;
if two people have different clocks, or live in different timezones,
both may be right in their own way.

Statements also need to be precise:
if someone says that it is _not exactly_ one o'clock
while another says that it is _approximately_ one o'clock,
both may be saying the truth.

## Ideas and Definitions

The most common statements that are considered in logic are of objects having properties,
like the old adage "Socrates is human".
So let us start with an unambiguous statement:

> The sea is blue.

We are saying that the sea has the property of being blue.
Such a plain idea should be valid everywhere and at any point in time, right?
Except.
As long as I can reasonably say the following sentence, we may have a contradiction:

> The sea is not blue.

The sea has many hues of color depending on the time of the year.
But let's agree that "generally the sea is blue".
So let's ask our friend Homer of The Iliad fame what color is the sea:
he will say at least 17 times in his works that it is [wine-colored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine-dark_sea_(Homer)).
Was he color-blind? Did he have an issue with colors?
Yes, he did have the issue that the blue color had not been invented yet.
Very likely he noticed that wine and the sea have different colors;
but just as we call "blue" a wide gamut of colors,
for the ancient Greek "wine-colored" also expanded a huge variety of tones,
which happened to include the color of the sea at times.

The absence of the color blue in most languages until recent times
leads some people to conclude that "early humans were colorblind"
([source](https://mymodernmet.com/shades-of-blue-color-history/)
including the ancient Greek.
This absurd notion is a very common confusion of "perception" and "idea".

## Reality

As we explored in [The Amazing Mind](/2016/the-amazing-mind),
what we call "reality" is just the complete network of concepts and ideas that we handle to face the world.
It is therefore separated from what is "true",
which is the world where we speak.

So in reality we are dealing with human ideas.
In truth there are no hours,
