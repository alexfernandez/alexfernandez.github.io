As reasonable people we dislike contradiction:
it is one of the telltale marks of the cheating kid,
of the dishonest politician,
and of the feeble mind.
However it is not easy to escape from its claws,
and whatever we do to dispel it,
it seems to come back to bite us in the ankles.

In this article we begin a study in this intriguing subject,
and we will start by trying to define it.

## So, What Is a Contradiction?

In the field of logic there is a beautiful definition:

> A contradiction means asserting a statement and its contrary.

For instance, if I say that "it is one o'clock" and "it is not one o'clock" at the same time,
I am immersed in a contradiction that needs to be solved one way or the other.

Note that in this very simple example we are presupposing that there is one authentic immutable truth;
if two people have different clocks, or live in different timezones,
both may be right in their own way.

Statements also need to be precise:
if someone says that it is _not exactly_ one o'clock
while another says that it is _approximately_ one o'clock,
both may be saying the truth.

## Ideas and Definitions

The most common statements that are considered in logic are of objects having properties,
like "Socrates is human".

## Reality

As we explored in [The Amazing Mind](/2016/the-amazing-mind),
what we call "reality" is just the complete network of concepts and ideas that we handle to face the world.
It is therefore separated from what is "true",
which is the world where we speak.

So in reality we are dealing with human ideas.
In truth there are no hours,
