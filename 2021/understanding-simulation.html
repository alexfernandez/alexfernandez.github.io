<p>This is the second part of our journey to understand quantum entropy. In the <a href="/2021/understanding-entropy">first part</a> we saw that the physical concept of entropy is basically another name for “information required to describe a system”. This basic result will be useful in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="living-inside-a-computer">Living Inside a Computer</h2>
<p>A few years ago certain celebrities started divulging the idea (not at all new) that we are living inside a simulation. Among them: Elon Musk, Neil Degrasse Tyson.</p>
<p>At some points some scientists advanced this wonderful argument: there can only be one real Universe, but inside it there can be any number of life-like simulations. Therefore it is much more likely that we are in one of those simulations than inside the real Universe, just because of probabilities. After all, if there are many tickets but only one gets the price, all things being equal it is much more likely that we don’t win the price. Isn’t it just common sense? As we will see, all things are not equal.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, the Simulators are hypothetical creatures that are running the simulation where we supposedly reside.</p>
<h2 id="a-thermodynamical-argument">A Thermodynamical Argument</h2>
<p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease; it will either stay constant or increase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we saw in the <a href="/2021/understanding-entropy">first part</a>, entropy is just another name for information to describe a system. If information is always increasing, there is no way that a computer can simulate the whole Universe: no matter how big the computer is, at some point it will run out of information storage. This is the basic idea</p>
<h3 id="thermo-tricks">Thermo Tricks</h3>
<p>There are many tricks in the simple formulation above of the Second Law. First, it may apply to an isolated system, but what happens to an open system? Its entropy can decrease as long as it is transferred to another open system. All in all, entropy for the combination of both systems cannot decrease. The same idea applies recursively to any combination of systems until we reach the whole Universe.</p>
<p>Next, we may ask ourselves: what if the entropy of the closed system stays constant, neither decreasing nor increasing? This doesn’t help either: the entropy of a closed system will only remain constant for a reversible process. Any transfer of energy done in finite time is irreversible; only theoretical, infinitely slow processes can be reversible.</p>
<h3 id="robustness">Robustness</h3>
<p>Sir Arthur Eddington <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics#Quotations">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme position among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell’s equations – then so much the worse for Maxwell’s equations. If it is found to be contradicted by observation – well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second law has also been shown to <a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/news-detail/does-the-second-law-hold-at-cosmic-scales-1345680342044.html?noticiaid=1345794120443">hold at cosmic scales</a>, that is, to the whole Universe.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-computer">What Is A Computer?</h3>
<h2 id="enter-the-matrix">Enter The Matrix</h2>
<p>Is it possible that we live in a Matrix-like simulation? That is, a Universe created just for us, limited human creatures, to live our little lives in a certain portion of time? This simulation can be thought to</p>
<h2 id="why-a-simulation">Why a Simulation?</h2>
<p>If it’s so clear that we cannot live in a computer simulation that any Internet rando with a blog and an elementary grasp of Physics can disprove it, So why do so many clever people insist that we <strong>must surely live in a simulation</strong>?</p>
<p>I think it is psychologically comforting for people to downplay their existence: inside a computer simulation it is not so important that our world is cruel, or unfair, or just plain weird. Those are just settings that the Simulators are playing with.</p>
<p>It is not so different from the mechanism that makes some religions comforting: this world is but a test of our spirits, the real life will come later in Heaven.</p>
<p>Well, I think it is important to confront the Universe with all its marvel and misery.</p>
<h3 id="a-mythological-explanation">A Mythological Explanation</h3>
<p>According to the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/GundersenMarius/status/1250186936779706375">Marius Gundersen</a>, tweeting about Wolfram Physics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It follows the millennium old pattern of us explaining our existence using our most advanced technology. Ancient people (many places) believed we were created from clay, their most advanced technology and we believe we live in a computer simulation, our most advanced technology. Everytime between people have attempted to explain the world using their most advanced models or metaphors. And so will we in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The simplistic idea that we live in a computer simulation is plainly wrong: there is no sane definition of “computer” and “simulation” where our Universe can reside.</p>
<p>We will soon continue our journey exploring quantum entropy.</p>
