<p>Maybe it has happened to you: since working remotely, your day is a
blurry continuum of online meetings. There is something missing, some
<strong>magic</strong> that happened at the office. And I‚Äôm not just
speaking about the free coffee and all the water cooler bad jokes.
(Which you are also allowed to miss by the way.)</p>
<p>So, what is it that we are lacking, and what can we do about it?
Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>
<h3 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h3>
<p>But first a short note about myself. I am Alex Fern√°ndez, I have been
CTO at Hivency since January 2021. And I have been working for 23 years
already, which means that I‚Äôm super-old! I am known as <a
href="https://twitter.com/pinchito">pinchito on Twitter</a>, and as
‚ÄúPapucho‚Äù by my daughter.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I have worked mostly remotely since 2011, so I should know what I‚Äôm
speaking about! (In fact most of the time I don‚Äôt know anything, but
this will be our little secret üòâ)</p>
<h2 id="remote-meetings">Remote Meetings</h2>
<p>OK, back to our little issue. You know the feeling: you are working
from home for a few hours. You have one online meeting after the other,
and after a while they start to blur into one another.</p>
<p>If you think about the situation, it is no mystery: this is a very
monotonous situation for the mind. Sitting in the same place all day
with little distractions is great for deep work, the kind that you do
alone like reading a report or writing code. But not so much for
interacting with people: we really enjoy changing settings from time to
time!</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Online meeting and the changing faces
effect. Source: adapted from
https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Dwarfs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Videoconferencing tools do not help either: faces appear at seemingly
random positions on the screen, which can even change in the middle of a
conversation!</p>
<h3 id="some-memorable-clues">Some Memorable Clues</h3>
<p>So why is it so hard to have memorable conversations online? A first
clue appears when you go back to the office, and start talking to people
about meetings they have had. If they come from Southern Europe they
will immediately start waving their hands, pointing to the imaginary
locations where they were standing for each encounter. (And yes, many
other cultures also gesture a lot.)</p>
<p>What is going on? When gesturing people follow their minds, so there
must be a deeply hidden reason for this. This is what made me start to
pull the thread. What I found will perhaps surprise you!</p>
<h2 id="spatial-memory">Spatial Memory</h2>
<p>It is a well-known fact that memory works very well when associated
with particulart places. In an office you are moving constantly, meeting
people in different places, and this helps remember what everyone said
and when. Working always from home messes with all this.</p>
<h3 id="memorable-events">Memorable Events</h3>
<p>Each conversation seems to be mentally affixed to the location where
it takes place. In fact, people are transported in their imagination to
the <em>place and time</em> where it happened. When we are online we
lose these valuable cues, and can only turn back to a rough idea of the
time when something happened.</p>
<p>A similar effect happens with important events in our life. In old US
movies everyone remembers where they were when they heard about the
assassination of JFK; in my generation something similar happens with
the World Trade Center attacks. I‚Äôm sure that millennials will have
their own defining event, like the unveiling of a new Pokemon or
something.</p>
<h3 id="the-method-of-loci">The Method of Loci</h3>
<p>A popular technique for remembering things is to assign memories to
specific locations on a route that is well known, and then to recall
them by walking back the same path. This technique is often called ‚Äúthe
memory palace‚Äù, or the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">method of
<em>loci</em></a> if you want to show off your Latin.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sort-of-artistic depiction of the memory
palace. Source: adapted from
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Meeting_Room_Niavaran_Palace.JPG.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is in fact the most widely used technique by <a
href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-you-can-train-your-brain-memory-champion-still-forget-your-car-keys-180962496/">memory
champions</a>, and mentioned by no less than our fictional friends <a
href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/science/memory/a-look-inside-a-memory-champions-mind-palace/">Sherlock
Holmes</a> and <a
href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/hannibal-lecter/">Hannibal
Lecter</a>. Plus, it is a good way to count cards and get banned at
casinos! üòé</p>
<p>Does it also work for most of us normal people? Well, you probably
use a variation of the same technique when visiting the supermarket: you
go over the same path and remember to buy your favorite products at the
same places. You may have noticed that some supermarkets play with our
feelings by changing products often so that <a
href="https://bettermarketing.pub/the-secret-brilliant-and-questionable-strategy-supermarkets-use-to-make-you-spend-more-ca553c3c6135?gi=efd9d02be71d">we
buy new products</a>. I hate you, Mercadona! üò∞</p>
<h3 id="inevitable-evolutionary-argument">Inevitable Evolutionary
Argument</h3>
<p>Why are we so good at remembering places? The answer will surprise
you: it involves a bunch of <em>Australopithecus</em> looking for food
in the African savannah, and‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Nah, not really. If you have ever owned a cat (and we love cats at
Hivency Tech üò∏) you know that they are <em>very</em> aware of their
surroundings. In fact, all kinds of animals have some kind of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_cognition">spatial
cognition</a>, from birds to cuttlefish. It is no wonder that our memory
has adapted to remembering places, landmarks and routes.</p>
<p>Since we have that wonderful capability, why not use it to our
advantage?</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do-about-it">What Can We Do About It?</h2>
<p>Now it‚Äôs time to suggest some improvements. Can we do something to
improve the memorability of our meetings in these pandemic times?</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-office">Back to the Office</h3>
<p>A first obvious suggestion is to go to the office every once in a
while to have meetings with people. This may not be really workable
if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you work for a company on the other side of the world,</li>
<li>your company sold off their office space,</li>
<li>you reject societal norms including basic personal hygiene,</li>
<li>or you have some other condition that prevents you from going to the
office.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of us it can be really helpful to get our wet chassis to
the office every once in a while. In June 2021 I had a really fruitful
visit to the lovely Hivency office in Paris, as seen at the top of the
article; reposted here for your convenience:</p>

</figure>
<p>I was lucky because many of my colleagues also went to the office
that week, and I tried to meet as many of them as possible. For me it‚Äôs
quite easy to recall these conversations because I can remember where
they happened, and then I get more easily to what was spoken.</p>
<p>By the way, Paris is still wonderful, and even better without
tourists. So hurry and pay a visit!</p>
<h3 id="move-around">Move Around</h3>
<p>Suppose you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt go to the office, no matter how many free
amenities the company sets up there to entice you. Well, there is a poor
person‚Äôs alternative: at least change settings for important meetings.
If at all possible move to another room or even go to the park: I have
done a lot of fruitful meetings from a public park bench or table, and
sometimes I didn‚Äôt even have to fight with families or other <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo">hobos</a> to get a good picnic
table.</p>
<p>You can also just walk around. Just be careful not to get your
interlocutors dizzy with a walking camera panorama; if you are on the
move maybe it‚Äôs better to switch off the camera. By the way, did you
know that the mobile network is still working OK in most countries?
Enjoy a good old <em>vintage</em> conversation on your cellphone like
our grandparents used to do!</p>
<h3 id="the-notebook">The Notebook</h3>
<p>Perhaps you really, really cannot move at all: you are confined to
the one table you use, or it disrupts your workflow. Well, we are not
here to judge, and there is still hope for you! There is another visual
aid that will be there to help us: <em>The Notebook</em>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It may seem a bit stupid to mention notebooks in a rant about spatial
memory, but after all the objective is to make your meetings memorable.
Writing stuff down has been proven in the last 5000 years or so to help
people remember things. Plus, there is also a spatial component to
writing things down in a notebook, which a text file on a computer does
not have: position in the page and page in the notebook. Together they
create a crumb trail that may help you trace back your thoughts
later.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Memory works best when it has spatial aids. Online meetings remove
many of the location cues that help us have memorable conversations, but
we can still supplement them to help our poor brains:</p>
<ul>
<li>going to the office every once in a while,</li>
<li>changing location to another room or even an open space,</li>
<li>or writing things down on a notebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope these tips help!</p>
<h3 id="remote-work-at-hivency">Remote Work at Hivency</h3>
<p>At Hivency most employees have the option to work remotely, and the
company pays for a trip to the office every month to see our colleagues.
This helps immensely to cement relationships and make our meetings
memorable. Oh, and did I tell you that <a
href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/es/companies/hivency">we are
hiring</a>?</p>
