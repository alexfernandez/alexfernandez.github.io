  Is it possible to make your online meetings more memorable?
  Remote work is very productive in some ways,
  but can be challenging in others.
  The monotonous setting do not help.

Maybe it has happened to you:
since working remotely, your day is a blurry continuum of online meetings.
There is something missing,
some _magic_ that happened at the office.
And I'm not speaking just about the free coffee and all the water cooler bad jokes.
(Which you are also allowed to miss by the way.)

So, what is it that we are missing,
and what can we do about it?
Let's delve in!

### About the Author

But first a short note about myself.
I am Alex Fernández,
I have been CTO at Hivency since January 2021.
And I have been working for 23 years already,
which means that I'm super-old!

I am known as
[pinchito on Twitter](?),
and as "Papucho" by my 12-year-old daughter.

![Papucho.](pics/remote-memory-papucho?.jpg "A gorgeous drawing in pencil and charcoal by my daughter, depicting a bearded guy that suspiciously resembles myself. Source: the author.")

I have worked mostly remotely since 2011,
so I should know what I'm speaking about!
(In fact most of the time I don't,
but this will be our little secret :wink:)

## Remote Meetings

OK, back to our little issue.
You know the feeling:
you are working from home for a few hours.
You have one online meeting after the other,
and after a while they start to blur into one another.

If you think about the situation, it is no mystery:
it is a very monotonous situation for the mind.
Sitting in the same place all day with little distractions
is great for deep work,
the kind that you do alone like read a report or write a document.
But not so much for interacting with people:
we really enjoy changing settings from time to time!

![Online meeting and the changing faces effect.](pics/remote-memory-changing?.jpg "Changing faces in an online conference. Source: the author.")

Videoconferencing tools do not help either:
faces appear at seemingly random positions on the screen,
which can even change in the middle of a conversation!

### Some Clues

So why is it so hard to have memorable conversations online?
A first clue appears when you go back to the office,
and start talking to people about meetings they have had.
If they are from Southern Europe they will immediately start waving their hands,
pointing to the imaginary locations where they were standing for each encounter.
(Yes, many other cultures also do the same.)

What is going on?
And why this extemporaneous cultural stereotype?
For the last part I can be excused because I'm from Southern Europe myself;
in fact, many of my best friends are from Southern Europe.
As to the handwaving itself, there must be a deeply hidden reason for this.

## Spatial Memory

It is a well known fact that memory works very well when it refers to places.
Working always from home messes with it.
In an office you are moving constantly,
meeting with people in different places,
and this helps remember what people said and when.

### Memorable Events

Conversations seem to be mentally affixed to the location where they took place.
In fact, people are transported in their imagination to the _place and time_ where it happened.
When we are online we lose these valuable cues,
and can only turn back to a rough idea of the time when something happened.

A similar effect happens with important events in our life.
In old US movies everyone remembers where they were when they heard about the assassination of JFK;
in my generation something similar happens with the World Trade Center attacks.
I'm sure that millennials will have their own defining event,
like the unveiling of a new Pokemon or something.
(Damn kids! Get off my lawn by the way!)

### The Method of Loci

A popular technique for remembering things is
to assign memories to specific locations on a route that is well known,
and then to recall them by walking back the same path.
This technique is often called "the memory palace",
or the
[method of _loci_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)
if you want to show off your Latin.

![The memory palace](pics/remote-memory-palace.jpg "A palace room with lots of notes; note that the _method of loci_ does not actually require imagining a palace. Source: adapted from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Meeting_Room_Niavaran_Palace.JPG.")

This is in fact the most widely used technique [ref](?) by memory champions,
and mentioned by no less than our fictional friends
[Sherlock Holmes](?)
and
[Sheldon Cooper](?).
It is the best for counting cards at casinos! :sunglasses:

Does it also work for most of us normal people?
Well, you probably use a variation of the same technique when visiting the supermarket:
you go over the same path and remember to buy your favorite products at the same places.
You may have noticed that some supermarkets play with our feelings
by changing products often so that we discover new products.
[ref](?)
I hate you, Mercadona! :sweat:

### Inevitable Evolutionary Argument

Why are we so good at remembering places?
The answer will surprise you:
it involves a bunch of _Australopithecus_ looking for food in the African savannah,
and...

Nah, not really.
If you have ever owned a cat
(and we love cats in Hivency tech :happy-cat:)
you know that they are _very_ aware of their surroundings.
In fact, all kinds of animals have some kind of
[spatial cognitiion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_cognition),
from birds to cuttlefish.
It is no wonder that our memory has adapted to remembering places,
landmarks and routes.

Since we have that wonderful capability,
why not use it to our advantage?

## What Can We Do About It?

Now it's the time for me to suggest improvements.
Can we do something about having more memorable remote meetings in these pandemic times?

### Back to the Office

A first obvious suggestion is to go to the office once in a while to have meetings with people.
This can not be really workable if:
* you work for a company on the other side of the world,
* you are quarantined,
* you reject societal norms including basic personal hygiene,
* or you have some other condition that prevents you from going to the office.

For the rest of us it can be really helpful
to get our wet chassis to the office every once in a while.
As seen at the top of the article,
reproduced here for your convenience,
I had a really fruitful visit to Paris in June 2021:

![Map of selected meetings at the Hivency office in Paris.](pics/remote-memory-hivency.jpg "A map of the location of the Hivency office, with notes about where meetings happened and with whom. Source: adapted from https://zoom.earth/#view=48.858296,2.349495,20z.")

For me it's quite easy to recall these conversations
because I can remember where they happened,
and this transports me to that moment.

By the way, Paris is so lovely,
and even better without tourists.
So hurry and pay a visit!

### Move Around

Suppose you can't or won't go to the office,
no matter how many free amenities we set up there to entrap you.
Well, there is a poor person's alternative:
at least change settings for important meetings.
If at all possible move to another room or even go to the park:
I have done a lot of fruitful meetings from a public park bench or table.

You can also just walk around.
Just be careful not to get your interlocutors dizzy with a walking camera panorama;
if you are on the move maybe it's better to switch off the camera.

### The Notebook

Perhaps you really, really cannot move at all:
you are confined to the same room,
or it disrupts your workflow.
Well, we are not here to judge.
There is another visual aid that will be there to help you:
_The Notebook_.

![I really like these notebooks (not a sponsor).](pics/remote-memory-notebook?.jpg "A few notebooks piled up. Source: the author.")

it may seem a bit stupid to mention notebooks in a rant about spatial memory,
but after all the objective is to make your meetings memorable.
Writing stuff down has been proven in the last 5000 years or so to help people remember things.

But there is also a spatial component to writing things down in a notebook,
which a text file on a computer does not have:
position in the page, and page in the notebook.
Together they create a crumb trail that may help you trace back your thoughts later.

## Conclusions

Memory works better when it has spatial aids.
