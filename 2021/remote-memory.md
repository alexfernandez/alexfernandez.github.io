abstract:
  Remote work is very productive in some ways,
  but can be challenging in others.
  Online meetings can be less than memorable,
  and the monotonous settings do not help.

that memory works better when it refers to places, and working always from home messes with it.
In an office you are moving constantly, meeting with people in different places, and this helps remember what people said and when.
A final suggestion is to go to the office once in a while to have meetings with people.

## Conclusions

Memory works better when it has spatial aids.
