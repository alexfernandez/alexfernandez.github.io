</figure>
<p>After visiting <a href="understanding-entropy">entropy</a> and a
detour through <a href="understanding-simulation">simulated worlds</a>,
we continue our journey of understanding Physics with a puzzling theory:
<strong>quantum mechanics</strong>. What is it, and why does it
matter?</p>
<p>We will now see a gentle introduction without excessive maths, and
also without sacrificing rigorous thinking. In the process we will
explore some very fundamental questions in Physics like ‚Äúwhat is a
particle?‚Äù or ‚Äúcan we predict how things behave?‚Äù.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-question">‚ùì The Basic Question</h2>
<p>Since antiquity philosophers have been trying to answer the question
poised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus">Democritos
of Abdera</a> some 2400 years ago: what are the smallest constituents of
reality? The goal posts have moved a lot since then.</p>
<p>Early attempts were just educated guesses and broad descriptions:
there simply was no way to gather observations that were accurate
enough. By the early 1900s scientists had very precise measurements of
how particles behaved, and it was really different than everything we
knew until then. In the coming years some brave pioneers would formalize
what is now known as quantum mechanics.</p>
<h2 id="the-double-slit-experient">ùåÇ The Double Slit Experient</h2>
<p>We are not going to study the formalism of quantum mechanics, but we
will try to get an idea of what‚Äôs so different about subatomic
particles. To that end we will explore the following situation <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja0HSFj8Imc">proposed by Richard
Feynman</a>: a stream of particles coming out of a hole in a somewhat
random direction propagate towards two slits in a wall. After the two
slits there is a solid wall with detectors, so each particle will be
detected once it reaches the wall at the end.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/understanding-quantum-mechanics-setup.svg"
title="A source of particles point downwards towards two slits, with some going through each; at the bottom a wall of detectors is waiting to catch them, with a click! Source: the author."
alt="The double-slit experiment setup." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The double-slit experiment
setup.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then we make a graph of how many particles reach each detector. What
do you expect we should see?</p>
<h3 id="particles">üé± Particles</h3>
<p>First we will consider that we are dealing with particles as we
usually imagine them: little balls that bounce off walls. Each particle
can only go through one slit at a time, and will be detected only once
at the end. Keep in mind that particles can also bounce off the
separations, which by the way are not perfectly smooth so the particles
can take unexpected directions. Below you can find a gross simulation of
how the experiment might go. The first slit at the top is just a way to
focus the stream of the particles.</p>
<script src="/physics-simulation/double-slit/controller.js"></script>
<script src="/physics-simulation/double-slit/particle.js"></script>
<canvas id="particle-canvas" width="200" height="532" style="border: solid black 1px; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
</canvas>
<div>
<form>
<input id="particle-speed" style="display: none;" type="number" value="1">
<button id="particle-run" type="button">run</button>
<button id="particle-pause" type="button">pause</button>
<button id="particle-reset" type="button">reset</button>
</form>
</div>
<p>If you click on ‚Äúrun‚Äù you will see that particles are detected along
the whole wall, due to random reflections. They tend to follow a smooth
pattern: first you will see spikes where you would expect them for
particles that go straight through both holes. Then there are a smaller
number of particles that have bounced off the slits and go in different
directions. By the way, you can play with the simulation <a
href="https://pinchito.es/physics-simulation/double-slit/particle">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="waves">üåä Waves</h3>
<p>Just for fun, what would happen if instead of particles we had waves?
Imagine we have a pool of water with a few partitions reproducing our
experiemental setup, and the source is now a perturbation in the water
causing waves at the top of our diagram. We will see the water
oscillating with a different amplitude at each point. Again, what would
you expect to see?</p>
<p>We can use a simple model of wave propagation to simulate the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">wave equation</a> in
two dimensions. We cannot count particles at the bottom graph now, but
we can accumulate instead the square of the wave amplitude, which by the
way represents the energy of the oscillation at that point. As before,
the first slit at the top is just a way to focus the initial circular
wave.</p>
<script src="/physics-simulation/double-slit/wave.js"></script>
<canvas id="wave-canvas" width="200" height="532" style="border: solid black 1px; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
</canvas>
<div>
<form>
<input id="wave-speed" style="display: none;" type="number" value="2">
<button id="wave-run" type="button">run</button>
<button id="wave-pause" type="button">pause</button>
<button id="wave-reset" type="button">reset</button>
</form>
</div>
<p>Again clicking on ‚Äúrun‚Äù will show you how waves propagate, first
through the top slit and then through the two slits below. This
simulation is also available to play with <a
href="https://pinchito.es/physics-simulation/double-slit/wave">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that now there are some places in the wall
where we get no waves at all. Correspondingly, the graph shows no energy
accumulating there. What is happening?</p>
<p>What we see here is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference">interference</a>.
Each of the slits acts as a new source of waves, so what reaches the
bottom is the sum of both oscillations. In some places the ridges of one
wave matches exactly with the valleys of the other, so the net effect is
perfectly calm water. At other places both waves are perfectly
synchronized so the net effect is a bigger oscillation.</p>
<h3 id="particles-or-waves">üïµÔ∏è Particles or Waves</h3>
<p>Now we have seen both versions. How would you expect a beam of
electrons to behave, like particles or like waves?</p>
<p>At this point you are probably thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But pinchito, what kind of nonsense is this? Electrons are particles,
and they will behave like such! They can only pass through one hole, so
there can be no interference between both slits at the bottom!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, you‚Äôd be surprised.</p>
<h2 id="double-slits-in-practice">üî¨ Double Slits in Practice</h2>
<p>The best to settle the debate is probably to do the experiment. So,
what if I tell you that electrons show interference?</p>

<p><a
href="http://materias.df.uba.ar/f4Aa2012c2/files/2012/08/multiple_slit.pdf">Claus
J√∂nsson at Universit√§t T√ºbingen</a> actually did the experiment with
electrons in 1973. Guess what: he got peaks and valleys, the true sign
of interference.</p>
<p>Some scientists were not yet happy: in an electron beam there can be
multiple electrons going through each slit at the same time, so they
suggested that electrons going through different slits could interfere
with each other. The only way to check if there is <strong>interference
for a single electron</strong> is to send them one at a time. And that
is exactly what an Italian team did in 1974: <a
href="https://www.fisica.unam.mx/personales/romero/IFC2015/Merli-Mizziroli-Pozzi-AJP-1976.pdf">P
G Merli, G F Missiroli and G Pozzi 1976 Am. J. Phys. <strong>44</strong>
306‚Äì7</a>. Again, lots of interference! <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc-iyjpzzGQ">This delicious
film</a> shows the results.</p>
<p>There is a very nice summary of the history of the experiment in <a
href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-7058/16/5/24/pdf">John
Steeds et al 2003 Phys. World <strong>16</strong> (5) 20</a>.
Interference for a single electron going through a double slit is well
tested experimentally.</p>
<h3 id="which-slit">üîé Which Slit?</h3>
<p>We can make a perfectly reasonable question: which slit does each
electron go through? Since the electron is detected only once at the
bottom, we can deduce that it must have gone through only one slit. To
settle the debate we can install detectors at each slit, that will tell
us which path each electron takes.</p>
<p>So we do this in our mental experiment, and find out that we can
reliably detect electrons passing through the slits. Now that we know
which slit each electron went through, we will settle the debate!</p>
<p>Next we check the pattern at the bottom: we find <strong>no
interference</strong>. The resulting graph will be more similar to the
curve we generated above for particles, smooth and without the typical
bands generated by interference. How can this be?</p>
<p>Since we are sending the electrons one at a time, we can even
correlate the slits with the clicks detected at the bottom of our graph.
Particles that went through the left slit will generate a pattern
exactly as if the right slit was closed, and viceversa. We can try to
detect particles only in one slit. The result will be, again: <strong>no
interference</strong>. Apparently interference is so shy that just
trying to pinpoint it makes it disappear.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/understanding-quantum-mechanics-detector.svg"
title="A light source shines towards the slit; whenever a particle comes through, it deflects some of the photons that will reach a detector. Source: the author."
alt="A detector is made with a source of light that crosses the slit, and a sensor activated when the light is deflected by a passing particle." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A detector is made with a source of light
that crosses the slit, and a sensor activated when the light is
deflected by a passing particle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can also try to use a more subtle detector that will not disturb
our electrons so much. After all, the simplest detector is just a
constant beam of photons that will flicker whenever an electron passes
through. So we can try to use a beam with less intensity (and thus
shining less photons per second). The result will be curious: some
electrons will go undetected, generating interference, while those that
are detected generate a smooth curve.</p>
<p>Why not try a detector that uses red light, which is just a source of
photons with less energy per particle? Again we may be surprised by the
results: when electrons are unambiguously detected the resulting curve
will show interference, but when electrons go undisturbed by the red
light there will be no bands.</p>
<p>So, the situation seems to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>No detectors ‚Üí interference.</li>
<li>Detectors ‚Üí no interference.</li>
<li>One detector ‚Üí no interference.</li>
<li>Weak detectors ‚Üí little interference.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is, simply put, how Nature behaves. Now we have all the
information we need to delve into quantum mechanics.</p>
<h2 id="the-quantum-way">‚öõÔ∏è The Quantum Way</h2>
<p>When physicists were confronted with this state of affairs they had
to make a difficult choice: do we want to keep speaking about particles,
or do we describe everything as waves?</p>
<h3 id="quantum-wave-function">„Ä∞Ô∏è Quantum Wave Function</h3>
<p>Moved by their familiarity with magnitudes such as magnetic fields,
which have a different value for each point in space, some scientists
like Schr√∂dinger (yes, the guy that gave name to the famous cat) had no
reservations in defining a new type of field to explain this wave-like
behaviour: a <em>wave function</em>. This is how the guy that gave name
to the famous cat experiment came up with the famous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schr√∂dinger
equation</a>. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#History">Wikipedia
article</a> helpfully clarifies that it was Max Born who first
interpreted the quantum wave function as a <em>probability
amplitude</em>, which when squared would give the <em>probability
density</em>: the probability of finding the particle at each point in
space.</p>
<p>It is this wave function that is passing through both slits at the
same time, and which causes bands to appear in the detectors. This is
the famous <em>wave-particle duality</em> which causes quantum objects
to behave ‚Äúsometimes like particles, sometimes like waves‚Äù: <strong>a
particle is described by a wave function that determines its possible
positions</strong>. Propagate like a wave, be detected as a single
particle.</p>
<h3 id="precise-simulation">üßë‚Äçüî¨ Precise Simulation</h3>
<p>The wave simulation that we saw at the beginning is not exact for
quantum wave functions. As you can see below, a more realistic
simulation based on Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation still shows interference
after passing a double slit.</p>
<figure>
<video src="pics/understanding-quantum-mechanics-simulation.webm"

</figure>
<p>The particle has a certain probability to be reflected by the double
slit, and another probability to pass through, with a very noticeable
interference pattern shown as a number of bands. As a footnote, I spent
many days trying to make a precise quantum simulation but with little
success, despite finding <a
href="https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/10876/are-there-simple-ways-to-numerically-solve-the-time-dependent-schr%c3%b6dinger-equati/10880#10880">a
promising method</a>. Luckily some good simulations can be found lying
around, such as <a
href="https://github.com/artmenlope/double-slit-2d-schrodinger">this
Python script from Arturo Mena</a>.</p>
<h3 id="explanations">üó£Ô∏è Explanations</h3>
<p>Now we are ready to explain the effects that we are seeing in the
double-slit experiment. In the original experiment we have a particle
moving through a first slit with a random direction, and then through
two slits which causes interference. Our explanation is that the wave
function is crossing through the slits, and then when reaching the end
wall the particle is detected at some point that depends on how the
waves have propagated through space. That is why our measurements show
interference: the wave propagated through one slit interferes with the
wave propagated through the other.</p>
<p>Things complicate a little bit when we add the detectors at the
slits. Why do we suddenly lose all interference? There are three
complementary explanations which can be enlightening. First, there‚Äôs the
famous ‚Äúthe act of measurement affects the result‚Äù: when we add
detectors in the slits, the emitted photons are disturbing our electrons
and causing changes in the results.</p>
<p>The second viewpoint adds a bit more detail. When a particle is
detected at one of the slits, the old wave function disappears and is
replaced by a new wave function, in this case propagating from a single
slit. This is usually called the <em>collapse of the wave function</em>:
the wave function is reset as a result of a measurement.</p>
<p>The third viewpoint is more technical: adding a detector causes an
effect called <em>decoherence</em>. This phenomenon is quite deep and
will be studied in a separate article.</p>
<h3 id="playing-dice">üé≤ Playing Dice</h3>
<p>With the quantum description we have suddenly introduced a subtle but
important effect: suddenly we are not calculating the position of a
particle, but computing a <em>probability</em> of where the particle
will be. Same is true about the particle speed: we get a range of
probabilities that the particle will have a certain speed when
measured.</p>
<p>Does this mean that we cannot know with precision the position or
speed of a particle? In short, yes. The wave function fills all space:
some positions will be more likely than others, but in principle the
particle can be detected <em>anywhere</em>. In practice the wave
function only has significant values in a limited range.</p>
<p>This ambiguity leads to all kinds of funny phenomena, like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling">tunneling
effect</a>: a quantum particle can be found even in places where it
would be impossible according to classical mechanics. Say that a
particle is approaching an obstacle which is impenetrable: it simply
doesn‚Äôt have enough energy to cross it. In quantum mechanics there is a
small but finite probability that the particle will pass the
obstacle.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/understanding-quantum-mechanics-tunneling.gif"
title="A wave approaches from the left a thin barrier at the origin of coordinates. After reaching the barrier there are two waves of approximately the same height: one reflected going back, and one that has skipped the barrier.

alt="Quantum tunneling through a barrier with a very high, but narrow potential barrier at the origin (x=0). There is equal probability that a particle will be reflected or pass the barrier." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Quantum tunneling through a barrier with
a very high, but narrow potential barrier at the origin (x=0). There is
equal probability that a particle will be reflected or pass the
barrier.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This tunneling effect is not just a theoretical curiosity; it has
multiple applications in today‚Äôs technology such as transistors, nuclear
fission or the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunnelling_microscope">scanning
tunneling microscope</a>.</p>
<p>In any concrete situation, will the particle be reflected or will it
continue its way? There is no way to predict what will happen exactly;
we can only compute the probabilities of each event, which will be
approximately reached if we repeat the same experiment many times. On
large scales probabilities will tend to average so we can have a pretty
good idea of how things will behave; that is why in our common world we
don‚Äôt need to worry too much about probability densities. But once
things start getting sufficiently small, wave functions are the only
description that makes sense.</p>
<p>Having probability as the basis of quantum mechanics is what led
Einstein to reject it, famously saying that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein#Free_will">God
does not play dice with the universe</a>. Nowadays most physicists have
accepted it without questioning, since experiments have failed to find
any hidden theories that may give us a more deterministic picture.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">‚åõ Conclusion</h2>
<p>The theory of quantum mechanics explains reality with particles that
are described by a wave, but which can still be found in just one place
at a time. The double-slit experiment is a particularly good interesting
illustration of this pesky behaviour.</p>
<p>We will soon continue our journey exploring quantum entropy. One
question that we may make ourselves is: but aren‚Äôt photons also
particles? How come they are described as electromagnetic waves? And the
answer will require a deep dive in the history of quantum mechanics.</p>
