  Are we living inside a computer simulation?
  Many celebrities and even reputed scientists think we are.
  Armed with a little basic science,
  I will try to refute those ideas in this article.

This is the second part of our journey to understand quantum entropy.
In the [first part](/2021/understanding-entropy)
we saw that the physical concept of entropy is basically another name for
"information required to describe a system".
This basic result will be useful in what follows.

## Living Inside a Computer

A few years ago certain celebrities started divulging the idea
(not at all new)
that we are living inside a simulation.
Among them:
Elon Musk,
Neil Degrasse Tyson.

At some points some scientists advanced this wonderful argument:
there can only be one real Universe,
but inside it there can be any number of life-like simulations.
Therefore it is much more likely that we are in one of those simulations
than inside the real Universe,
just because of probabilities.
After all,
if there are many tickets but only one gets the price,
all things being equal it is much more likely that we don't win the price.
Isn't it just common sense?
As we will see,
all things are not equal.

For the purpose of this article,
the Simulators are hypothetical creatures that are running the simulation where we supposedly reside.

## A Thermodynamical Argument

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that:

> The entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease;
> it will either stay constant or increase.

As we saw in the 
[first part](/2021/understanding-entropy),
entropy is just another name for information to describe a system.
If information is always increasing,
there is no way that a computer can simulate the whole Universe:
no matter how big the computer is,
at some point it will run out of information storage.
This is the basic idea that proves we are not living in a computer simulation.

### Thermo Tricks

There are many tricks in the simple formulation above of the Second Law.
First, it may apply to an isolated system,
but what happens to an open system?
Its entropy can decrease as long as it is transferred to another open system.
All in all, entropy for the combination of both systems cannot decrease.
The same idea applies recursively to any combination of systems
until we reach the whole Universe.

Next, we may ask ourselves:
what if the entropy of the closed system stays constant,
neither decreasing nor increasing?
This doesn't help either:
the entropy of a closed system will only remain constant for a reversible process.
Any transfer of energy done in finite time is irreversible;
only theoretical, infinitely slow processes can be reversible.

### Robustness

Sir Arthur Eddington [stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics#Quotations):

> The law that entropy always increases holds,
> I think, the supreme position among the laws of Nature.
> If someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's equations
> – then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations.
> If it is found to be contradicted by observation
> – well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes.
> But if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope;
> there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.

The second law has also been shown to
[hold at cosmic scales](https://www.uab.cat/web/news-detail/does-the-second-law-hold-at-cosmic-scales-1345680342044.html?noticiaid=1345794120443),
that is, to the whole Universe.

## What Is A Computer?

So our next line of attack will probably be to redefine what a "computer" is,
so that it can accommodate an always-increasing simulation.

### Many Dimensions

### Enter The Matrix

If it's impossible to simulate a complete working Universe,
is it possible that we live in a Matrix-like simulation?
In the 1999 film
[The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix)
there is a simulation created just for us,
limited human creatures,
to live our little lives in a certain portion of time.

A certain version of the computer simulation _could_ be possible:
if it is restarted whenever the person in it dies.
There is nothing unlimited in the life of a person,
so in theory it _could_ be successfully simulated in a limited computer.
But note that this is a much more solipsistic version of the idea.
It is not a simulation of our whole Universe;
just of the life of a person.
In fact every person would have to live in separate universes.

The thing starts to complicate if everyone in the Matrix shares the same simulation,
as depicted in the movie.
In this case information starts to accumulate again:
even if one person dies and their information is removed,
some of that information needs to be kept around because other people will remember it.
We will have artifacts from long dead people,
word of mouth or even recordings, that need to be kept around.
Again, information grows uncontrollably,
and after a few generations the system will be expected to collapse.
We can postulate "glitches in the Matrix"
that happen whenever the system needs to erase information to make room for new experiences,
but they would be noticeable to the inhabitants.

Even if we limit ourselves to one generation,
keeping information about the external world coherent would require us to simulate the whole Universe.
After all, anyone in the Matrix can take a picture of the galaxies in a certain portion of the sky,
store it somewhere,
then take another a few years later with another telescope and check if they are the same.
It would take a very clever computer to maintain all the relevant information of the Universe
so that both pictures are mostly the same,
except for the occasional supernovae.

Another argument against such a simulation is that it is impossible to do a perfectly coherent simulation:
the simulated laws of Physics are always short of the real deal.
One example is anisotropy:
if we measure the laws of movement in all directions we should be able to tell how the building blocks are aligned,
that is, where the axes of coordinates are.

Then there's the whole plot gap that it is impossible to use humans as batteries:
we will always consume more energy than we produce,
also a consequence of the Second Law by the way.
But let's keep to the simulation aspects of the movie.

## Why a Simulation?

If it's so clear that we cannot live in a computer simulation
that any Internet rando with a blog and an elementary grasp of Physics can disprove it,
So why do so many clever people insist that we **must surely live in a simulation**?

I think it is psychologically comforting for people to downplay their existence:
inside a computer simulation it is not so important that our world is cruel,
or unfair,
or just plain weird.
Those are just settings that the Simulators are playing with.

It is not so different from the mechanism that makes some religions comforting:
this world is but a test of our spirits,
the real life will come later in Heaven.

Well, I think it is important to confront the Universe
with all its marvel and misery.

### A Mythological Explanation

According to the developer
[Marius Gundersen](https://twitter.com/GundersenMarius/status/1250186936779706375),
tweeting about Wolfram Physics:

> It follows the millennium old pattern of us explaining our existence using our most advanced technology.
> Ancient people (many places) believed we were created from clay, their most advanced technology
> and we believe we live in a computer simulation, our most advanced technology.
> Everytime between people have attempted to explain the world using their most advanced models or metaphors.
> And so will we in the future.

## Conclusion

The simplistic idea that we live in a computer simulation is plainly wrong:
there is no sane definition of "computer" and "simulation" where our Universe can reside.

We will soon continue our journey exploring quantum entropy.
