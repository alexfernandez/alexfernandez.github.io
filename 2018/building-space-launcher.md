Space guns, and more specifically mass drivers,
are a long-standing alternative means of reaching space.
In this article we will explore how to build one today.

## Going to Mars… and Back

Rockets have dominated space exploration since the beginning.
They have served us well for reaching the Moon,
first with probes and then for a few select astronauts.
Mars however is a different story.

### NASA

NASA has sent a few very successful robotic probes to Mars.

### SpaceX

Elon Musk often speaks about reaching Mars.

## The Space Gun

The plan is to build a space gun with existing technologies.
It is easy to envision futuristic means of transportation,
as we will see in the next section;
but a space gun is well within the state of the art,
and can be realistically built in the next decade.

In essence it is just a long coilgun.

### Location

The ideal place for launch is a very high mountain:
like the one in the Himalayas or in the Andes.
This reduces air density and therefore drag on the projectile.
But construction at very high altitudes is complex.
Also, remote locations are hard to reach.

A compromise location is a relatively high mountain near Europe.
I propose to use
[Pico del Teide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide),
a 3718 m high peak in Spain.
It has the ideal curvature: it raises 3.7 km in 14 km,
which gives a launch angle of approx. 15°.

Pico del Teide is part of Teide National Park,
which means that it is protected:
in particular, exploitation of natural resources is forbidden.
An exemption should be made in this case,
since a mass driver would preserve the environment.
There is precedent: it has been used
(appropriately enough)
as a Mars testbed due to its
[similar conditions](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4767403.stm).

It is also an active volcano,
so maybe it is not the best idea to use it.
Apart from volcanic eruptions,
[tectonic movements](https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/717563/Canary-Islands-earthquake-tremors-Tenerife-Mount-Teide-volcano)
are common in the area,
and may damage the tunnel.
But it is a feasible location,
even if a more suitable mountain is eventually found.

### Big Tunnel

The space gun is based on a long tunnel
in which a near vacuum has been created.
How long is the tunnel?
It depends on a couple of operational parameters:
maximum acceleration and launch velocity
(measured at the end of the tunnel).

Such a large tunnel with a near vacuum may not seem easy.
But in fact it is not outside the realm of possibility.
Think of
[CERN LHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider):
a 27 km long circular tunnel with a perfect vacuum.
It was originally built in 1988 for the LEP.

### Construction

### Launch

### Atmospheric Passage

When reaching the atmosphere the vehicle will be moving
at a very high speed.

### Cargo

### Human Tripulated Ship

## Other Options

Mass drivers are not the only option.

### Space Elevator
