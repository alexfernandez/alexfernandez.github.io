</div>
<p>Space launchers, and more specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver">mass drivers</a>, are a long-standing alternative to rockets for reaching space. In this article we will explore how to build one today.</p>
<h2 id="the-space-gun">The Space Gun</h2>
<p>We present a plan to build a space gun with existing technologies. It is easy to envision futuristic means of transportation, as we will see in the next sections; but a space gun is well within the state of the art, and can be realistically built in the next decade.</p>
<p>In essence it is just a long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coilgun">coilgun</a> in a vacuum: electromagnetic forces push a vehicle up a tunnel, until it enters the atmosphere and hopefully reaches space with the impulse. Our aim is to reach low earth orbit (LEO), and more specifically 400 km, which happens to be the altitude of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</a>. The speed required is 7.7 km/s (27,600 km/h; 17,200 mph).</p>
<p>We will use a reference speed of 9 km/s at the moment of leaving the coilgun, allowing for speed losses due to drag. Our reference vehicle weight will be 10 tons. How can we get it to space?</p>
<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>The ideal place for launch is a very high mountain, which reduces air density and therefore drag on the vehicle after leaving the tunnel. But construction at very high altitudes is complex. Also, remote locations are hard to reach: mountains above 8000 m high can only be found in the Himalayas and the nearby Karakoram.</p>
<p>A compromise location is a relatively high mountain near Europe. Here we will build our space launcher at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide">Pico del Teide</a>, a 3718 m peak in Spain. It has the ideal curvature: it raises 3.7 km in 28 km, with a steeper slope near the peak.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/building-elevation.jpg" title="Teide elevation profile, source: https://www.mapdevelopers.com/elevation_calculator.php" alt="Curvature of Teide is almost ideal." />
<p class="caption">Curvature of Teide is almost ideal.</p>
</div>
<p>Pico del Teide is part of Teide National Park, which means that it is protected: in particular, exploitation of natural resources is forbidden. An exemption can be made in this case, since a mass driver will largely preserve the environment. There is precedent: it has been used (appropriately enough) as a Mars testbed due to its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4767403.stm">similar conditions</a>.</p>
<p>There are also a few complications. Teide is an active volcano; apart from volcanic eruptions, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/717563/Canary-Islands-earthquake-tremors-Tenerife-Mount-Teide-volcano">tectonic movements</a> are common in the area and may damage the tunnel. To make it a feasible location comprehensive geological studies need to be performed to avoid any hot spots of volcanic activity.</p>
<p>To prevent accidents the precise location must be chosen carefully: there need to be no villages on the slope opposite the tunnel entrance. Any failed launches will probably fall in the sea, but if post-lauch speed is below 500 m/s they might fall on the island. Also, a wide area near the tunnel exit and along the intended trajectory will need to be evacuated whenever launches are scheduled.</p>
<p>I contend that a space launcher will also be a major tourist attraction, both for the mountain and the island. The entry point can be visited all year round. Together with the influx of high quality jobs the space launcher should be a major boom for the island.</p>
<h3 id="big-tunnel">Big Tunnel</h3>
<p>The space gun is based on a long tunnel in which a near vacuum has been created. It spans 28 km from sea level to the top of the Teide. Such a large tunnel with a near vacuum may seem crazy, but it is not outside the realm of possibility at all. Think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">CERN LHP</a>: a 27 km long circular tunnel with a perfect vacuum. It was originally built in 1988, and completely refurbished in 2006 for <a href="https://tunneltalk.com/CERN-Aug01-Construction-of-great-excavations2.php">approximately 200 million USD</a>.</p>
<p>Can this tunnel make us reach our target speed of 9 km/s? As it happens a constant acceleration of 150g applied for about 6 seconds along 28 km will do the trick. Computations are <a href="#Computations">detailed below</a>.</p>
<p>Synchronization of the coils is essential. <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA426465&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf">Davis says in &quot;Advanced Propulsion Study&quot;, p. 22</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accelerations of 100,000 – 250,000 g are theoretically possible. However, only small, low velocity, low acceleration laboratory-scale devices have been demonstrated with projectiles of a few hundred grams. Also, the experimental scale-up for space transportation applications has not yet been addressed. There is no practical technical limit to the launch velocity and length of the barrel in coilguns, but performance is ultimately limited by thermal and mechanical failure of the drive coils, along with the voltage and current limitations of the silicon-controlled rectifiers used for switching. The failure mode of superconducting drive coils operating under fast pulse conditions is a subject requiring experimental study. There is also the problem that magnetic friction at the end of the muzzle drags down the muzzle velocity of the projectile by several percent, and this has not yet been solved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A coil gun will have to be a very large, complex, power-hungry device requiring rapid switching of large amounts of power in order for it to launch space transportation sized payloads. A 10-ton projectile will require switching electrical power at several hundred kilovolts in the stator coils. This will require a large dedicated power plant and energy storage system. The quenched coils in a superconducting coilgun generate a great deal of heat, and thus a cryogenic refrigerator to remove the heat would have to be scaled so large that such a gun cannot be applied to space transportation. No experimental tests have been done using superconducting (high-temperature type) drive coils and armatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some insights can be found in papers by <a href="https://coilgun.info/theorymath/ieee/design_power_condition.pdf">Zabar <em>et al</em>, 1989</a>, and <a href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/seniordesign/sp2014su2014/g10/research/other_sources/00599800.pdf">Cravey <em>et al</em>, 1995</a> and <a href="https://www.coilgun.info/theorymath/ieee/pulse_limits_1997.pdf">Williamson &amp; Smith, 1997</a>. According to <a href="https://www.coilgun.info/theorymath/ieee/coilgun_primer.pdf">Marder (1993)</a> it is possible.</p>
<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>Construction will proceed in stages. Entries every kilometer should allow easy access to the tunnel for repairs.</p>
<p>A regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_boring_machine">Tunnel boring machine</a> or TBM should do the job, and keep costs low.</p>
<p>The coilgun consists of a big number of wire loops, each with a current passing through it at the exact moment that the vehicle reaches it. The tunnel must have a near vacuum to avoid friction with the vehicle, so it needs high performance pumps and seals.</p>
<p>Superconducting wires can store current without loss. They have been successfully used in several maglev projects; the low temperatures required can be reached relatively easily in a sealed tunnel.</p>
<h3 id="launch">Launch</h3>
<p>Before each launch all coils must be charged.</p>
<p>At the precise moment of launch the vehicle lies at rest at the foot of the tunnel. The tunnel passage would be very swift: it will take around 6 seconds to reach our target speed of 9 km/s.</p>
<p>After firing all coils the projectile should reach our reference speed of 9 km/s. With a mass of 10 tons the kinetic energy would be 400 Gigajoules, or 110 Megawatt·hour. At a standard price of €0.10 per Kw·h, and assuming an efficiency of 80%, the total cost per launch is €14k. An efficiency of 90% <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA426465&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf">has been estimated</a>. Even with lower efficiencies the cost is not dramatic.</p>
<p>The whole power needs to be released in 6 seconds, and so result in an insane power release of 67 Gigawatt. But electrical power can be generated slowly and stored in the coils themselves if they are superconducting, or in batteries otherwise. Assuming the coils can be charged in 24h only 4 megawatt are needed, which can be achieved with a <a href="http://www.macon.com/news/business/article30238353.html">small solar farm</a>.</p>
<p>The top of the tunnel should open automatically. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_window">plasma window</a> has been proposed, but it is not necessary: a regular diaphragm is enough to keep air out of the tunnel and open in a few seconds.</p>
<h3 id="atmospheric-passage">Atmospheric Passage</h3>
<p>When reaching the atmosphere the vehicle will be moving at a very high speed. Since the vehicle is launched from a relatively low altitude, aerodynamics must be considered. To reach low earth orbit (LEO) it should fly at at least 7.8 km/s; and considerably more if we take drag into account.</p>
<p>We can take as reference a post-launch speed of 9 km/s; this is almost Mach 30, and the vehicle would instantly be hypersonic. Impact with air would result in a tremendous deceleration.</p>
<p><a href="http://pinchito.es/mass-driver/drag.html">This simulation</a> allows you to change several parameters and simulate the flight.</p>
<h3 id="vehicle">Vehicle</h3>
<p>Having a heavy vehicle is important to withstand drag forces upon entering the atmosphere: a light vehicle would lose too much speed as to reach LEO. A 10-ton vehicle would be similar in weight to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurofighter_Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/main.shtml">waverider design</a> should allow the vehicle to reduce drag, and therefore reach LEO with our design speed. Note that several hypersonic vehicles have been designed and operated to date.</p>
<p>Construction of this vehicle may seem like a big task, but what we have is basically a glider with no motors. It should be much cheaper to build than hypersonic planes.</p>
<p>The vehicle can be made to reenter the atmosphere and be reused multiple times. An ablation shield must then be used to absorb the heat of reentry. Another option is to build cheap disposable vehicles.</p>
<p>Magnetic levitation might be impractical for an aerodynamic vehicle. An interesting option is to embed the vehicle in a cylindrical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabot">sabot</a> with optimal magnetic properties, and then discard it at exit. This is the technique used for military railguns. As a bonus the sabot might absorb part of the shock when entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The vehicle itself can be used for unmanned exploration.</p>
<h3 id="cargo">Cargo</h3>
<p>Cargo is limited to what the vehicle can carry aboard. The kind of cargo bay that can be fit in the vehicle is not large, but it can carry a sizeable weight: of the 10 tons for the complete vehicle around half might be cargo. But even one ton would be a great help to space exploration. Obviously the space launcher would not be able to send large payloads to LEO, so it would not be a substitute to rockets, for now. But it is very useful to send supplies to orbiting spaceships, such as the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
<p>Certifying the cargo for an acceleration of 150 g should not be hard.</p>
<h3 id="human-tripulated-ship">Human Tripulated Ship</h3>
<p>The problem of transporting humans is entirely different. We are squishy and do not tolerate well accelerations beyond 4 g. On a 28 km tunnel the exit speed would be of at most 1500 m/s. The vehicle should carry enough fuel to reach LEO after that.</p>
<p>This launch speed would be no small feat.</p>
<p>That is, unless we visit more exotic options. Fighter pilots regularly withstand <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980223621.pdf">more than 10g</a>, which would give us 2366 m/s. This speed is almost as much as the delta-v generated by the first stage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Saturn V</a>, and can be used to launch a small rocket to LEO. This acceleration would be sustained for only 12 seconds: with a proper suit a trained subject would remain conscious.</p>
<p>A human in a liquid tank should resist higher accelerations.</p>
<h2 id="going-to-mars-and-back">Going to Mars… and Back</h2>
<p>Rockets have dominated interplanetary exploration since the beginning of the space age. They have served us well for reaching the Moon, first with probes and then by a few select astronauts. Mars however is a different story.</p>
<p>Travelling to Mars is quite easy: many probes have been sent there. The problems start when you want to return afterwards. With only 0.16g launching from the Moon was easy enough, and could be done with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascent_Propulsion_System">relatively low-powered system</a>. But Mars gravity is more than twice at 0.38g, and also there is an atmosphere. A proportionally big rocket is required to leave the Martian surface.</p>
<h3 id="spacex">SpaceX</h3>
<p>Elon Musk often speaks about reaching Mars. His plan is quite complex, depending on several launches and in-orbit refuelling. It is also quite expensive: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/science/elon-musk-spacex-mars-exploration.html">around 10 billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>The problem of reusable rockets is that they have not been proven in practice. The Space Shuttle program used reusable boosters and a reusable vehicle; it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Space_Shuttle_program">quite more expensive</a> than expendable alternatives which are still in operation.</p>
<p>SpaceX currently has the most powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_launch_systems">operational rocket</a>, the recently launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy">Falcon Heavy</a>. Going to Mars requires a large ship, with a lot of fuel if they intend to get back.</p>
<p>A practical means of sending cargo up to Earth orbit would help lowering costs. Only the (mostly empty) spaceship and the tripulants needs to be sent up in a rocket; everything else including fuel can be sent up using a space launcher.</p>
<h3 id="nasa">NASA</h3>
<p>NASA has sent a few very successful robotic probes to Mars. But a manned (or should we say, &quot;peopled&quot;) rocket is a different story: they always seem to be a decade away from sending the first human expedition.</p>
<p>Funding is one issue: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA">diminishing budgets</a> have affected NASA's ability to embark in complex missions, and Mars is very far away and quite inhospitable. The lack of suitable vehicles is another important factor.</p>
<p>There is currently no vehicle capable of launching a big payload. Since the demise of the Space Shuttle NASA has had no powerful rockets of its own. It is planning to build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System">Space Launch System</a> in the next years, at a very high cost.</p>
<h3 id="other-systems">Other Systems</h3>
<p>Blue Origin has plans for space exploration. The company is <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/jeff-bezos-lifts-curtain-blue-origin-rocket-factory-vision-space/">not yet ready</a> to reach Mars. China is also planning missions to Mars, but the outlook is <a href="https://www.chinaspaceflight.com/rocket/Heavy-Lift-Launch-Vehicle/Heavy-Lift-Launch-Vehicle.html">still very uncertain</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-options">Other Options</h2>
<p>Mass drivers are not the only alternative to rockets. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rocket_spacelaunch">few ideas</a>, some of which we will consider here.</p>
<h3 id="star-tram">Star Tram</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTram">Star Tram</a> concept is very similar to the space launcher considered here. Gen-1 is cargo-only; acceleration is slower than here (30 g), and therefore exit speeds are smaller. Gen-2 relies on 20 km high launch and is not feasible yet.</p>
<h3 id="space-elevator">Space Elevator</h3>
<p>Dramatically illustrated by Arthur C. Clarke in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountains_of_Paradise">The Fountains of Paradise</a>, a space elevator consists of a very long tether reaching from LEO to Earth surface. It is not yet a practical concept.</p>
<h3 id="launch-loop">Launch Loop</h3>
<p>Another great idea that is well outside the realm of possibility right now.</p>
<h2 id="computations">Computations</h2>
<p>Detailed computations are presented here.</p>
<h3 id="kinetic-parameters">Kinetic Parameters</h3>
<p>We have to accelerate a 10-ton vehicle to 9 km/s in 28 km. Assume constant acceleration a. The motion is described by these two equations:</p>
<p>v = a · t, Dx = 1/2 · a · t^2</p>
<p>With our initial data:</p>
<p>v = 9 km/s Dx = 28 km</p>
<p>passage time can be computed as:</p>
<p>t = 2 · Dx / v = 2 · 28 · 10^3 m / (9 · 10^3 m/s) ~ 6.2 s.</p>
<p>Acceleration is thus:</p>
<p>a = v / t = 9 · 10^3 m/s / 6.2 s ~ 1.45 · 10^3 m/s^2.</p>
<p>Or 145 g, where g is the acceleration of gravity on Earth.</p>
<h3 id="energy-and-power">Energy and Power</h3>
<p>Kinetic energy can computed as:</p>
<p>E = m · v^2 / 2.</p>
<p>At 9 km/s a 10-ton vehicle will have:</p>
<p>E = 1/2 · 10^4 kg · (9 · 10^3 m/s)^2 ~ 400 · 10^9 J = 400 GJ</p>
<p>Or 400 gigajoules. That is <a href="http://online.unitconverterpro.com/conversion-tables/convert-group/factors.php?cat=energy&amp;unit=0&amp;val=400">111 megawatts-hour</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing">Electricity prices</a> vary wildly across Europe; we can use an industrial price of around €0.10 per KW·h. With 80% efficiency, total price is:</p>
<p>M = 111 MW·h · €0.10 / KW·h / 0.80 = €13875</p>
<p>or around €14K.</p>
<p>Power required depends on charging time. Assuming the tunnel can be charged over a 24h period:</p>
<p>P = E / t = 400 GJ / 86400 s = 4.63 MW</p>
<p>or around 4 megawatt.</p>
<h3 id="electricity-and-electronics">Electricity and Electronics</h3>
<p>By far the most complex part of the project.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A space launcher can be a great help for space exploration, enabling the supply of larger ships at a very low cost.</p>
<p>Nothing revolutionary has been proposed in this article; everything is based on existing technologies.</p>
