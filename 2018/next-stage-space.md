Mass drivers are a long-standing alternative means of reaching space.
In this article we will explore how to build one today.

## Going to Marsâ€¦ and Back

Rockets have dominated space exploration since the beginning.
They have served us well for reaching the Moon,
first with probes and then for a few select astronauts.
Mars however is a different story.

### NASA

NASA has sent a few very successful robotic probes to Mars.

### SpaceX

Elon Musk often speaks about reaching Mars.

## The Mass Driver

### Construction

### Big Tunnel

### Launch

### Atmospheric Passage

When reaching the atmosphere the vehicle will be moving
at a very high speed.

### Cargo

### Human Tripulated Ship

## Other Options

Mass drivers are not the only option.

### Space Elevator
