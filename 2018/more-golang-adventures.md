A couple of years I had the chance to play with Go
(or "Golang" as exasperated people searching on the web often use)
and wrote [part 1](../2016/golang-adventures.html) of this article.
In the last few weeks I have delved deeper into the gopher hole,
and have been discouraged from using it on large projects.
This longish rant explains why.

## More Language Fun

Criticizing those aspects of a programming language that we don't like
is an endless source of amusement.
So there you go.

### Pointless Pointers

After using C for any length of time, pointer arithmetic becomes 

This for me was the dealbreaker. But there's more.
Oh so much more.

### 

## Packages

## Tooling

### `gofmt`

It should be great when the creators of a language
also give you a [nice formatting tool](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/).
But remember, `gofmt` is brought to you by the same people who
[mandate inlined brace style](2016/golang-adventures.html#mandatory-brace-style).
So they saw it fit to remove spaces as an option,
and now mandate tabs everywhere.

![Richard Hendricks would [love it](http://popkey.co/m/K9yRZ-tabs-spaces-silicon-valley-funny)](pics/adventures-spaces.gif "Winnie types spaces")

## Momentum

### Performance

## Conclusion

A space launcher can be a great help for space exploration,
enabling the supply of larger ships at a very low cost.

Nothing revolutionary has been proposed in this article;
everything is based on existing technologies.

The author is a _dilettante_ that has had a lot of fun
working out the overall details of the project.
