										<h1>🫂 The Three Laws of Humanics</h1>
										<p>On Being Human<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Isaac Asimov introduced his <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws
of robotics</a> in his 1941 story <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaround_(story)">‘Runaround’</a>.
They are supposed to govern the behavior of robotic intelligences. In
short form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do not harm humans.</li>
<li>Obey orders from humans.</li>
<li>Protect yourself.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you had to sketch three laws to direct human behavior, what would
they be? I have given some thought to this matter lately. What follows
is my best attempt at sketching three sensible rules.</p>
<h1 id="people-over-things">🏘️ People over Things</h1>
<p>We should always tend to people first, before caring about things.
Let me tell you a short true story, as told by a friend of mine.</p>
<p>She was visiting an American-Japanese girl, in their family house.
While she was there the mother of the family was cooking all their
meals, tending to their needs and caring about them in general. Whenever
they came home everything was ready for both of them. My friend noticed
the house had an amazing Japanese garden, perfectly cared for. She asked
the mother:</p>
<p>‘That garden is awesome! It must take a huge effort to care for it.’
‘Yes’, replied the mother: ‘at least four or five hours a day’. ‘I don’t
understand’, my friend replied. ‘You take care of us all day long. How
do you manage to tend to the garden as well?’ ‘Sure, but people should
always take priority over things. I will take care of the garden once
you leave.’</p>
<p>This story is probably apocryphal: my friend has later said she has
no recolection of the matter. But it illustrates the point well: people
are the most important aspect in our lives, and they should take
priority over everything else.</p>
<h1 id="the-three-laws">📋 The Three Laws</h1>
<p>These three laws should make us better people.</p>
<h1 id="priorities">Priorities</h1>
<p>What priority should each law take? Are they like Asimov’s laws of
robotics, which must be followed in order? I.e. the first law takes
priority over the other two.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<p>Things are not a substitute for people, and they cannot be. Once we
have really intelligent robots they should probably still be</p>
