																				<p>Isaac Asimov introduced his <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws
of robotics</a> in his 1941 story <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaround_(story)">‘Runaround’</a>.
They are supposed to govern the behavior of robotic intelligences. In
short form:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do not harm humans.</li>
<li>Obey orders from humans.</li>
<li>Protect yourself.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="the-three-laws-for-humans">The Three Laws for Humans</h1>
<p>If you had to sketch three rules to direct human behavior, what would
they be? I have given some thought to this matter lately. What follows
is my best attempt at sketching three sensible rules in a similar spirit
to Asimov’s: to help us take moral decisions.</p>
<h2 id="people-over-things">🏘️ 1: People over Things</h2>
<p>The first rule is to <strong>care about people over things</strong>.
Let me tell you a short story, as referred by a friend of mine.</p>
<p>A female friend was visiting an American-Japanese girl in their
family house. While she was there the mother of the family was cooking
all their meals, tending to their needs and caring about them in
general. Whenever they came home everything was ready for both of them.
My friend noticed the house had an amazing Japanese garden, perfectly
cared for. She asked the mother:</p>
<p>‘That garden is awesome! It must take a huge effort to care for it.’
‘Yes’, replied the mother: ‘at least four or five hours a day’. ‘I don’t
understand’, my friend replied. ‘You take care of us all day long. How
do you manage to tend to the garden as well?’ ‘Sure, but people should
always take priority over things. I will take care of the garden once
you leave.’</p>
<p>This story is probably apocryphal: my friend has later said she has
no recolection of the matter. But it illustrates the point well: people
are the most important aspect in our lives, and they should take
priority over everything else.</p>
<h2 id="take-care-of-those-closer-to-you">🤗 2: Take Care of Those
Closer to You</h2>
<p>The second rule is <strong>take care of people closer to you before
others</strong>. This may sound egotistical or outright selfish. However
the opposite would lead us to very weird behavior, which we have often
seen and which some find admirable, but I don’t think faciliates a sane
society.</p>
<p>Consider the life of the biologist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._Price">George Price</a>,
as narrated in Tim Harford’s podcast <a
href="https://timharford.com/2025/06/cautionary-tales-the-man-who-solved-kindness/">The
Man Who Solved Kindness</a>. From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] he began showing an ever-increasing amount (in both quality and
quantity) of random kindness to complete strangers. In this way, he
dedicated the latter part of his life to helping the homeless, often
inviting homeless people to live in his house. […] He also gave up
everything to help alcoholics; yet as he helped them steal his
belongings, he increasingly fell into depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact Price had discovered an equation that showed how animals are
more likely to help their kin, as they carry part of the same genetic
material. This is sometimes called genetic altruism. However in humans
this is not so clear cut; the biologist precisely wanted to show that
human altruism is above all this gene stuff. Meanwhile he was
overlooking his family and friends.</p>
<p>For another counterexample let’s look at what the French philosopher
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Jean-Jacques
Rousseau</a> did with <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024569?seq=1">his five
children</a>: he sent them all to an orphanage, with the idea that they
would be better educated there. Meanwhile his writings were enlightening
the French society of his time, but his behavior looks equally
despicable.</p>
<p>Suppose we took care of everyone in the same degree. This would
definitely mean that we overlook our family and friends, and anyone that
have helped us in the past. In a perfect world perhaps we would all get
what we need. In practice just a few rotten individuals would spoil the
whole system, getting the benefit but not doing the work. Also we would
be unable to keep any friends or family, or any safety networks that we
build with our care and effort.</p>
<h2 id="protect-the-vulnerable">🐤 3: Protect the vulnerable</h2>
<p>The third rule is quite succint: <strong>protect the
vulnerable</strong>. This most important rule of being human is what
makes us keep our babies alive, our sick tended for, our elderly live
long happy lives, and in general lets us be decent human people.</p>
<p>I don’t think this point needs much justification. The opposite would
be “don’t take care of the vulnerable”, which has distinct nazi vibes.
“Survival of the fittest” is good enough for animals in the savannah and
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches">finches
in the Galapagos</a>, but hardly a principle for humans to live by in
society.</p>
<h1 id="the-three-laws">📋 The Three Laws</h1>
<p>The aim of these three laws should make us better people. In fact I
use them almost daily, especially the first one. Whenever I’m glued to a
screen, no matter how interesting it is whatever I’m doing, and someone
asks me anything I remind myself: ‘People over things’ and pay attention
to them. (Except if it’s work I’m doing, in which case I am actually
helping my colleagues and indirectly my family.)</p>
<h1 id="but-we-are-not-robots">🤖 But We Are Not Robots</h1>
<p>Of course we are not robots, and that is why I’m speaking about
“rules” rather than “laws”. (The title would not be as catchy
though.)</p>

</figure>
<p>All of these rules must be qualified: * What is “people”? Where do
animals stand? * What does “closer to you” mean? Family, friends,
colleagues, people that look like you, people with the same interests? *
Who are “the vulnerable”? Does it include minorities, protected classes,
people mistreated by society?</p>
<p>I have my own answers for each of these questions, but I think part
of the fun is figuring out the answers on our own.</p>
<h1 id="priorities">Priorities</h1>
<p>Another apparent subtlety for applying the rules is even more
important. What priority should each rule take? Asimov’s laws of
robotics must be followed in order, i.e. the first law takes priority
over the other two, then the second over the third, and finally the
third.</p>

</figure>
<p>In our case the priorities are not so clear, especially between the
second and third rules.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">🤔 Conclusion</h1>
<p>Things are not a substitute for people, and they cannot be. Once we
have really intelligent robots they should probably still be</p>
