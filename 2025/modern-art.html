										<h1>üé® How Many Arts Are There?</h1>
										<p>Categorizing Modern Art<p>
									</header>
																				<p>What possible venues can the modern artist choose to express
themselves? Let us recall the definition we used in <a
href="./on-art">üé® Advice for the Modern Artist</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is any activity that intentionally transmits emotions among
humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="artistic-categories">Artistic Categories</h1>
<p>What particular area of expertise should the fledging artist choose?
In the past there were only a few options, but nowadays there are a lot
of avenues to express yourself. Let‚Äôs now delve into the tricky world of
categorizing art.</p>
<h2 id="fine-arts">Fine Arts</h2>
<p>The traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art">fine
arts</a> are according to Wikipedia: painting, sculpture, architecture,
music, and poetry. Theatre and dance were also commonly included.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that paintings or sculptures can convey powerful
emotions, and do this deliberately enough, as we can see below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/modern-art-goya-saturno.jpg"
title="Saturno devorando a su hijo: a dramatic human figure with long hair is eating a small bloody corpse, supposedly a Roman god eating a child."

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Saturn devouring his son, by Francisco de

href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Francisco_de_Goya,_Saturno_devorando_a_su_hijo_(1819-1823).jpg">Museo
del Prado via Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I have no concerns about poetry, theatre or dance either. But one of
those fine arts sticks out as being particularly inefficient for the
tranmission of sentiments: <strong>architecture</strong> creates living
spaces, it can create and express beauty, but the range of emotions that
it can express is severely limited. When a construction is more
functional than artistic, can it be said to be art? To be honest I have
a hard time getting emotions from buildings; and yet there are still
surprising findings.</p>

<h3 id="music-and-abstract-art">Music and Abstract Art</h3>
<p>We have not referred to music yet, and it is an interesting case. It
is true that music in its purest form (without words or voices) is often
seen as abstract. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreans</a>
wondered about the geometric nature of musical chords, found out
experimentally by plucking a string of different ratios. Why are some
chords sad, while others feel feisty?</p>
<p>In general, it is not clear how abstract art transmits whatever it is
supposed to be transmitting. Is it just displaying skill by the author,
a complex technique or the novelty of a new pattern? I must confess that
quite often I don‚Äôt get it, and apparently most people as it has never
gained widespread acceptance. And yet I can also feel some strong
emotions sometimes with exceptional works.</p>
<figure>

title="An abstract painting with a pinkish background, squiggles of many colors and darkened corners."

<p>But the fact is that music can transmit strong complex emotions. Film
soundtracks are usually instrumental, and they help carry the story
forward to the point that many movies feel naked without them. I will
add a more personal note: once I was feeling nostalgic at a jazz guitar
duo concert, only to learn later that <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZitIqcdt8&amp;t=1611s">the piece
was called ‚ÄúNostalgia‚Äù</a>. I‚Äôm sure you have had similar
experiences.</p>
<p>I cannot help but think that we have the ability to transmit powerful
emotions using our voices: cheerful chirps, sad intonations, whiny
howls, or imperative commands. Even birds have the power to make us feel
happy or sad with their songs. Is it possible that musical compositions
mimic these ‚Äúwired-in‚Äù patterns? In this case music would just be
emulating the sounds that we are programmed to resonate to.</p>
<p>So how can composers and performers deliver raw feelings just using
different notes and chords? The answer might be that since they are
human themselves, they can try different things and see how they make
themselves feel. Art through empathy is a powerful mechanism, and one
that is not available to artificial intelligence for obvious
reasons.</p>
<h2 id="modern-arts">Modern Arts</h2>
<p>Since the fine arts were categorized, technology has made possible
new ways of expressing emotions. Modern categories often include cinema,
photography and comics.</p>
<p>What about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts">applied arts</a> like
design or decoration? According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects
aesthetically pleasing, which as we have seen is a kind of feeling and
does therefore qualify under our definition.</p>
<p>We already saw this piece of algorithmic art:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions,
although they are not always categorized as art. Let‚Äôs review a few of
them, starting with the most obvious and going deeper with fringe
acts.</p>
<h3 id="computer-games">Computer Games</h3>
<p>The most consumed form of art nowadays: they create beauty, strike
fear, tell interesting and immersive stories. The gaming industry hires
lots of artists for character design and animation. The combination of
cinematic scenes and music is augmented by the ability to control some
characters in the game. There is a unique world of possibilities because
games are (unlike movies) never exactly the same. I think there is
little doubt that computer games can be artistic, even if the oldest
generations do not always get them.</p>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>Ads are designed to stimulate feelings like cravings or desire, and
yet I‚Äôm not sure they can be indeed considered as art. Not because they
are done for crass commercial interests; or should Michelangelo be
ashamed of accepting money for creating fancy propaganda for the
strongest powers of his time, like kings and popes?</p>
<p>No, it‚Äôs the intentionality of the message which makes me doubt.
Targets of ads are not necessarily receptive. And yet, when you see an
ad that really resonates, it can be a powerful experience.</p>
<h3 id="comedic-monologues">Comedic Monologues</h3>
<p>This category is interesting because it mainly transmits one emotion:
humor. But if we delve deeper we find that monologue authors can also
convey a wide range of complex feelings: empathy, bewilderment, comfort,
curiosity, tenderness, bouts of anger.</p>
<p>Humor is in general an interesting emotion. It can be a response to a
common trope, but also to an absurd situation, to danger or to cognitive
dissonance. We laugh in response to many different stimuli. The best
monologuists will play to a wild array of mechanisms, whose only common
pattern is that they result in laughter.</p>
<h3 id="eroticism-and-pornography">Eroticism and Pornography</h3>
<p>Another variant of art is when we are transmitting feelings of sexual
desire. There is little doubt that erotic literature and cinema can be
artistic, while pornography can be quite controversial. It is banned in
many cultures and poorly considered in many others. The difference seems
to be the open depiction of genitals and sexual acts.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that there are many such images in India, like
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Erotic_Kama_statues_of_Khajuraho_Hindu_Temple_de_Lakshmana_Khajur%C3%A2ho_India_2013.jpg">Kama
statues from Khajur√¢ho temple (NSFW)</a>. Below is an example of a less
known trend: pornographic figures in Christian Romanesque temples from
the 11th century. (They are usually labeled ‚Äúerotic‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt fool
anyone.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/modern-art-cervatos-colegiata.jpg"
title="Two small statues hanging from the church ceiling. One depicts a crudely carved woman holding up her legs and displaying her vagina, the other represents a squatting man with an enormous penis poking out."

</figure>
<p>Porn is quite explicit about transmitting feelings, more specifically
sexual arousal, so it would meet our definition of art. Still, I can
hardly recommend anyone to devote their careers to erotic or porn
modelling as it is really limiting artistically. There is little nuance
about doing sexual acts.</p>
<h3 id="news">News</h3>
<p>Under the guise of reporting, these brave people will try to arouse
our interest, while sometimes scaring or delighting the audience. Their
serious countenance cannot distract us from the fact that they are often
dealing with raw emotions.</p>
<h3 id="influencing">Influencing</h3>
<p>These people know how to make you feel stuff. Be it beauty over
Instagram, amazement over YouTube, or rage over shitposting.</p>
<figure>

Museum for Kunst via Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="gastronomy">Gastronomy</h3>
<p>Feeding people is not the point. A good meal can make you feel a
range of experiences.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>The ancient term <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> is described
in the Wikipedia page as ‚Äúthe art of persuasion‚Äù. It is really useful to
explain things to others so that they see them as advantageous. The
classic philosopher Socrates despised sophists since they learned to
defend both sides of an argument. But contemplating different points of
view can open your mind and widen your horizons.</p>
<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
<p>Magic makes you feel wonder.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-arts">The Dark Arts</h2>
<p>Going by our definition alone, we could think that there are
malicious activities which should be considered artistic. A synonym for
a scammer is ‚Äúcon artist‚Äù, or confidence trickster. In a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam">scam</a> you have to make the
victim, or ‚Äúmark‚Äù, feel confidence. Similarly in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> and other
forms of social engineering.</p>
<p>There are even worse activities like abuse or mobbing, where the
victim is made to feel miserable. I don‚Äôt think anyone sane would want
to call them arts even though there is transmission of emotions. We may
feel tempted to exclude negative emotions from our definition so we can
get rid of similar pursuits, but then we run the risk of banning also
tragedies or sad movies. How can we keep out this dark side to some
human activities which is highly damaging to people, and choose not to
consider it art?</p>
<p>To help us out of this predicament let‚Äôs look deeper into the
‚Äúintentionality‚Äù built into our definition. Should art require two-way
intentions, so that the artist wants to transmit emotions
<strong>and</strong> the audience wants to receive them? This is an
interesting question which probably needs more space to be answered. As
a quick note, some artists may abuse our confidence, promising some
emotions but then delivering in a completely unexpected way. Gaspar No√©
comes to mind as a famous director that makes <a
href="https://goldenglobes.com/articles/gaspar-noe-on-why-he-does-not-want-to-make-shocking-movies-anymore/">shocking,
controversial movies</a>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h1>
<p>Learn how to transmit feelings. It is useful in many ways of life; to
artists it is essential.</p>
