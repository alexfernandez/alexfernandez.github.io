										<h1>üé® How Many Arts Are There?</h1>
										<p>Categorizing Modern Art<p>
									</header>
																				<p>What possible venues can the modern artist choose to express
themselves? Let us recall the definition we used in <a
href="./on-art">üé® Advice for the Modern Artist</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is any activity that intentionally transmits emotions among
humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="artistic-categories">Artistic Categories</h1>
<p>What particular area of expertise should the fledging artist choose?
In the past there were only a few options, but nowadays there are a lot
of avenues to express yourself. Let‚Äôs now delve into the tricky world of
categorizing art.</p>
<h2 id="fine-arts">Fine Arts</h2>
<p>The traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art">fine
arts</a> are according to Wikipedia: painting, sculpture, architecture,
music, and poetry. Theatre and dance were also commonly included.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that paintings or sculptures can convey powerful
emotions, and do this deliberately enough, as we can see below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/modern-art-goya-saturno.jpg"
title="Saturno devorando a su hijo: a dramatic human figure with long hair is eating a small bloody corpse, supposedly a Roman god eating a child."
alt="Saturn devouring his son, by Francisco de Goya. Source: Museo del Prado via Wikimedia." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Saturn devouring his son, by Francisco de

href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Francisco_de_Goya,_Saturno_devorando_a_su_hijo_(1819-1823).jpg">Museo
del Prado via Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I have no concerns about poetry, theatre or dance either. But one of
those fine arts sticks out as being particularly inefficient for the
tranmission of sentiments: <strong>architecture</strong> creates living
spaces, it can create and express beauty, but the range of emotions that
it can express is severely limited. When a construction is more
functional than artistic, can it be said to be art? To be honest I have
a hard time getting emotions from buildings; and yet there are still
surprising findings.</p>

<h3 id="music-and-abstract-art">Music and Abstract Art</h3>
<p>We have not referred to music yet, and it is an interesting case. It
is true that music in its purest form (without words or voices) is often
seen as abstract. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreans</a>
wondered about the geometric nature of musical chords, found out
experimentally by plucking a string of different ratios. Why are some
chords sad, while others feel feisty?</p>
<p>In general, it is not clear how abstract art transmits whatever it is
supposed to be transmitting. Is it just displaying skill by the author,
a complex technique or the novelty of a new pattern? I must confess that
quite often I don‚Äôt get it, and apparently most people as it has never
gained widespread acceptance. And yet I can also feel some strong
emotions sometimes with exceptional works.</p>
<figure>

title="An abstract painting with a pinkish background, squiggles of many colors and darkened corners."

</figure>
<p>But the fact is that music can transmit strong complex emotions. Film
soundtracks are usually instrumental, and they help carry the story
forward to the point that many movies feel naked without them. I will
add a more personal note: once I was feeling nostalgic at a jazz guitar
duo concert, only to learn later that <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZitIqcdt8&amp;t=1611s">the piece
was called ‚ÄúNostalgia‚Äù</a>. I‚Äôm sure you have had similar
experiences.</p>
<p>I cannot help but think that we have the ability to transmit powerful
emotions using our voices: cheerful chirps, sad intonations, whiny
howls, or imperative commands. Even birds have the power to make us feel
happy or sad with their songs. Is it possible that musical compositions
mimic these ‚Äúwired-in‚Äù patterns? In this case music would just be
emulating the sounds that we are programmed to resonate to.</p>
<p>So how can composers and performers deliver raw feelings just using
different notes and chords? The answer might be that since they are
human themselves, they can try different things and see how they make
themselves feel. Art through empathy is a powerful mechanism, and one
that is not available to artificial intelligence for obvious
reasons.</p>
<h2 id="modern-arts">Modern Arts</h2>
<p>Since the fine arts were categorized, technology has made possible
new ways of expressing emotions. Modern categories often include cinema,
photography and comics.</p>
<p>What about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts">applied arts</a> like
design or decoration? According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects
aesthetically pleasing, which as we have seen is a kind of feeling and
does therefore qualify under our definition.</p>
<p>We already saw this piece of algorithmic art:</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/on-art-design.jpg"
title="Spirals in yellow, pink and black overlapping, composed of many thin lines, displaying beautiful moir√© patterns."

</figure>
<p>There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions,
although they are not always categorized as art. Let‚Äôs review a few of
them, starting with the most obvious and going deeper with fringe
acts.</p>
<h3 id="computer-games">Computer Games</h3>
<p>The most consumed form of art nowadays: they create beauty, strike
fear, tell interesting and immersive stories. The gaming industry hires
lots of artists for character design and animation. The combination of
cinematic scenes and music is augmented by the ability to control some
characters in the game. There is a unique world of possibilities because
games are (unlike movies) never exactly the same. I think there is
little doubt that computer games can be artistic, even if the oldest
generations do not always get them.</p>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>Ads are designed to stimulate feelings like cravings or desire, and
yet I‚Äôm not sure they can be indeed considered as art. Not because they
are done for crass commercial interests; or should Michelangelo be
ashamed of accepting money for creating fancy propaganda for the
strongest powers of his time, like kings and popes?</p>
<p>No, it‚Äôs the intentionality of the message which makes me doubt.
Targets of ads are not necessarily receptive. And yet, when you see an
ad that really resonates, it can be a powerful experience.</p>
<h3 id="comedic-monologues">Comedic Monologues</h3>
<p>This category is interesting because it mainly transmits one emotion:
humor. But if we delve deeper we find that monologue authors can also
convey a wide range of complex feelings: empathy, bewilderment, comfort,
curiosity, tenderness, bouts of anger.</p>
<p>Humor is in general an interesting emotion. It can be a response to a
common trope, but also to an absurd situation, to danger or to cognitive
dissonance. We laugh in response to many different stimuli. The best
monologuists will play to a wild array of mechanisms, whose only common
pattern is that they result in laughter.</p>
<h3 id="eroticism-and-pornography">Eroticism and Pornography</h3>
<p>Another variant of art is when we are transmitting feelings of sexual
desire. There is little doubt that erotic literature and cinema can be
artistic, while pornography can be quite controversial. It is banned in
many cultures and poorly considered in many others. The difference seems
to be the open depiction of genitals and sexual acts.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that there are many such images in India, like
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Erotic_Kama_statues_of_Khajuraho_Hindu_Temple_de_Lakshmana_Khajur%C3%A2ho_India_2013.jpg">Kama
statues from Khajur√¢ho temple (NSFW)</a>. Below is an example of a less
known trend: pornographic figures in Christian Romanesque temples from
the 11th century. (They are usually labeled ‚Äúerotic‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt fool
anyone.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/modern-art-cervatos-colegiata.jpg"
title="Two small statues hanging from the church ceiling. One depicts a crudely carved woman holding up her legs and displaying her vagina, the other represents a squatting man with an enormous penis poking out."

</figure>
<p>Porn is quite explicit about transmitting feelings, more specifically
sexual arousal, so it would meet our definition of art. Traditional
religions would hardly agree: they keep a separation between ‚Äúhigh‚Äù
(pious) and ‚Äúlow‚Äù (carnal) feelings, and whatever is in the middle.
Nothing related to sensual pleasure can ever qualify as <em>real</em>
art.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think this distinction has any merit. Still, I can hardly
recommend anyone to devote their careers to erotic modelling as it is
really limiting artistically. Even worse for porn: there is little
nuance about performing sexual acts on screen.</p>
<h3 id="news">News</h3>
<p>Now we enter the realm of categories which are perhaps a bit
surprising. Under the guise of reporting current events, newscasters and
reporters will try to arouse our interest, while sometimes scaring or
delighting the audience. Their serious countenance cannot distract us
from the fact that they are often dealing with raw emotions.</p>
<p>The best news people can ellicit a sense of wonder when transmitting,
while trying to keep their impartiality and objectivity. News is an
interesting genre.</p>
<h3 id="influencing">Influencing</h3>
<p>Influencers do not belong by far a traditional art. And yet, like it
or not, these people definitely know how to make you feel stuff. Some
specialize in showing beauty over Instagram, others generate amazement
over YouTube, and even others can easily make you feel rage over their
shitposting.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/modern-art-influencer.jpg"

</figure>
<p>There is a certain charisma involved. Quick reaction to the audience
is also essential. Modern algorithms allow influencers to react to their
followers almost in real-time, something that was previously only
possible with a live audience.</p>
<h3 id="gastronomy">Gastronomy</h3>
<p>For Plato gastronomy was the mundane reverse of medicine: the doctor
recommends what is good for you, while the cook only wants to create
pleasant experiences. Good enough; but then we have to concede that the
emotions</p>
<p>With high gastronomy feeding people is not the point: a good meal can
make you feel a range of feelings. The most imaginative cooks tell
stories with their dishes, take you to places while enjoying the trip.
Memorable dishes are even celebrated beyond their realms.</p>
<p>Some people may despise the culinary arts because they are ephemeral:
after you consume the dish there is nothing left. But music or dance
used to be no different until we learned how to record performances.
Even more, for most of us visiting a museum will be just as
fleeting.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>The ancient term <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> is described
in the Wikipedia page as ‚Äúthe art of persuasion‚Äù. It is really useful to
explain things to others so that they see them as advantageous. The
classic philosopher Socrates despised sophists since they learned to
defend both sides of an argument. But contemplating different points of
view can open your mind and widen your horizons.</p>
<p>Politicians may have a bad reputation in many areas, just as
sophists. I do not however doubt that the great majority are
hard-working and genuniely try to do good, especially in democracies.
The quality of their politicians depends on how honest their societies
allow them to be. The democratic process, when coupled with transparency
and accountability, can make wonders for the political class.</p>
<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
<p>Magic always makes you feel wonder. But some magicians have taken the
art to new levels.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/modern-art-tamariz.jpg"
title="A close-up picture of Juan Tamariz, with his characteristic glasses and purple hat."

href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anelim/6504696633">milenamphoto</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Tamariz">Juan Tamariz</a>
(Madrid, 1942) has always emphasized that a magic trick is a journey
that takes you to a fantastic land, and the magician is accompanying the
spectator along the way. He was also trained as a clown, a puppeteer and
a cinema director. Watching his many performances is a delight, and they
fill even the most seasoned magicians with wonder and delight.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-arts">The Dark Arts</h2>
<p>Going by our definition alone, we could think that there are
malicious activities which should be considered artistic. A synonym for
a scammer is ‚Äúcon artist‚Äù, or confidence trickster. In a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam">scam</a> you have to make the
victim, or ‚Äúmark‚Äù, feel confidence. You also need to engage their greed,
or some other desire. Similarly in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> and other
forms of social engineering. The arousal of emotions can be said to be
consensual, even if the consequences are not.</p>
<p>There are even worse activities where victims are made to feel
miserable, and there is some (or a lot of) consent from their parts.
Masochistic activities or domination definitely involve a lot of
emotions. I don‚Äôt think anyone sane would want to call them arts though.
We may feel tempted to exclude negative emotions from our definition so
we can get rid of these pursuits, but then we run the risk of banning
also tragedies or sad movies. How can we keep out this dark side to some
human activities which can be highly damaging to people, and choose not
to consider it art?</p>
<p>This is an interesting question, but I don‚Äôt have an answer. As a
quick note, some artists may abuse our confidence, promising some
emotions but then delivering in a completely unexpected way. Gaspar No√©
comes to mind as a famous director that makes <a
href="https://goldenglobes.com/articles/gaspar-noe-on-why-he-does-not-want-to-make-shocking-movies-anymore/">shocking,
controversial movies</a>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h1>
<p>There is only a small number of classical ‚Äúfine arts‚Äù, but there are
many ways in which we can express our emotions for others. Learning how
to transmit feelings is essential for artists, and useful for most of us
in life.</p>
<p>Considering a wider range of arts can help us understand modern
society. Some are old as time, like magic or gastronomy; but there are
newer forms which did not exist a few decades ago, like computer games
or influencing.</p>
