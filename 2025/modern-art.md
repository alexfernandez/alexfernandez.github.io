What possible venues can the modern artist choose to express themselves?
Let us recall the definition we used in [üé® Advice for the Modern Artist](./on-art):

> Art is any activity that intentionally transmits emotions among humans.

# Artistic Categories

What particular area of expertise should the fledging artist choose?
In the past there were just a few options,
but nowadays there are a few more options than we may think.
Let's now delve into the tricky world of categorizing art.

## Fine Arts

The traditional [fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) are according to Wikipedia:
painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and poetry.
Theatre and dance were also commonly included.

It cannot be denied that paintings or sculptures can convey powerful emotions,
and do this deliberately enough.

But one of the fine arts sticks out as being particularly inefficient for the tranmission of sentiments.
**Architecture** creates living spaces,
it can create and express beauty,
but the range of emotions that it can express is severely limited.
When a construction is more functional than artistic, can it be said to be art?
There are still surprising findings.

![Parc G√ºell by Antoni Gaud√≠ is one of those nice exceptions. Source: [Txllxt TxllxT via Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Barcelona_-_Parc_G%C3%BCell_-_Main_square_-_View_ESE_on_Curved_Mosaic_%26_Larger_entrance_building_1901-1903_by_Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD.jpg).](pics/modern-art-gaudi-parc-guell.jpg "A view of a parc from one of the seats, showing a dream-like arrangement of multi-colored seats and the entrance which looks like a hose from a children book.")

### Abstract Art

It is not clear how abstract art transmits whatever it is supposed to be transmitting.
Is it just displaying skill by the author, a complex technique or the novelty of a new pattern?
I must confess that quite often I don't get it,
and so seem to do most people as it has never gained widespread acceptance.
I can also feel some suppressed emotions sometimes with exceptional works.

![One of these works is 'Las estrellas y la gloria', by my teacher and accomplished artist Arturo. You have to see the original large format painting to get the full impact. Source: [Arturo Mart√≠n Burgos](https://www.arturomartinburgos.com/pintura/reciente.html), used with permission.](pics/modern-art-estrellas-y-gloria.jpg "An abstract painting with a pinkish background, squiggles of many colors and darkened corners.")

It is true that music in its purest form (without words or voices) is often seen as abstract.
The [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism) wondered about the geometric nature of musical chords,
found out experimentally by plucking a string of different ratios.
Why are some chords sad, while others feel feisty?
But the fact is that music can transmit strong complex emotions.
Film soundtracks are usually instrumental,
and they help carry the story forward to the point that movies feel naked without them.
On a more personal note,
once I was feeling nostalgic at a jazz guitar duo concert, only to learn later that
[the piece was called "Nostalgia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZitIqcdt8&t=1611s).
I'm sure you have had similar experiences.

I cannot help but think that we have the ability to transmit powerful emotions using our voices:
cheerful chirps, sad intonations, whiny howls, or imperative commands.
Even birds have the power to make us feel happy or sad with their songs.
Is it possible that musical compositions mimic these "wired-in" patterns?
In this case music would just be emulating the sounds of nature.

While I would not consider instrumental music abstract,
contemporary compositions often feel like it.
And to be honest I don't get them either.
So how can composers and performers deliver raw feelings just using different notes and chords?
The answer is that since they are human themselves,
they can try different things and see how they make themselves feel.
Art through empathy is a powerful mechanism,
and one that is not available to artificial intelligence for obvious reasons.

## Modern Arts

Modern categories often include cinema, photography and comics.

What about [applied arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts) like design or decoration?
According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects aesthetically pleasing,
which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does therefore qualify under our definition.

We already saw this piece of algorithmic art:

![An abstract design generated by computer, then "printed" used a modified CNC mill, and finally photographed. Source: [Casa Cactus](https://casacactus.es/), used with permission.](pics/on-art-design.jpg "Spirals in yellow, pink and black overlapping, composed of many thin lines, displaying beautiful moir√© patterns.")

There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions and could be considered art.
Let's review a few of them, starting with the most obvious and going deeper with fringe acts.

### Computer Games

The most consumed form of art nowadays, it is easy to create beauty, strike fear,
tell interesting and immersive stories.

### Advertising

Designed to stimulate feelings like cravings or desire.
I don't see the fact that these works are done for crass commercial interests as a demerit:
or should Michelangelo be ashamed of accepting money for doing propaganda for the strongest powers of his time,
i.e. kings and popes?

### Comedic Monologues

A category that transmits humor.

### Eroticism and Pornography

Transmits feelings of sexual desire.
There is little doubt that erotic literature and cinema can be artistic,
but pornography can be quite controversial.
It is banned in many cultures and poorly considered in many others.
The difference seems to be the open depiction of genitals and sexual acts.

It is common knowledge that there are many such images in India,
like the [Kama statues from Khajur√¢ho temple (NSFW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Erotic_Kama_statues_of_Khajuraho_Hindu_Temple_de_Lakshmana_Khajur%C3%A2ho_India_2013.jpg).
Below is an example of a less known trend:
pornographic figures in Christian Romanesque temples from the 11th century.
(They are usually labeled "erotic" but it doesn't fool anyone.)

![Detail of two figures in the collegiate church of San Pedro de Cervatos, 11th century, Spain. Source: [Jcdelorge via Jot Down Cultural Magazine](https://www.jotdown.es/2019/08/ruta-por-el-romanico-erotico/).](pics/modern-art-cervatos-colegiata.jpg "Two small statues hanging from the church ceiling. One depicts a crudely carved woman holding up her legs and displaying her vagina, the other represents a squatting man with an enormous penis poking out.")

Porn is quite explicit about transmitting feelings,
more specifically sexual arousal,
so it would meet our definition of art.
I can hardly recommend anyone to devote their careers to erotic or porn modelling,
as it is really limiting artistically.

### News

Under the guise of reporting, these brave people will try to arouse our interest,
while sometimes scaring or delighting the audience.
Their serious countenance cannot distract us from the fact that they are often dealing with raw emotions.

### Influencing

These people know how to make you feel stuff.
Be it beauty over Instagram, amazement over YouTube, or rage over shitposting.

### Gastronomy

Feeding people is not the point.
A good meal can make you feel a range of experiences.

### Politics

The ancient term [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric) is described in the Wikipedia page as "the art of persuasion".
It is really useful to explain things to others so that they see them as advantageous.
The classic philosopher Socrates despised sophists since they learned to defend both sides of an argument.
But contemplating different points of view can open your mind and widen your horizons.

### Magic

Magic makes you feel wonder.

## The Dark Arts

Going by our definition alone,
we could think that there are malicious activities which should be considered artistic.
A synonym for a scammer is "con artist", or confidence trickster.
In a [scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam) you have to make the victim, or "mark", feel confidence.
Similarly in [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) and other forms of social engineering.

There are even worse activities like abuse or mobbing,
where the victim is made to feel miserable.
I don't think anyone sane would want to call them arts even though there is transmission of emotions.
We may feel tempted to exclude negative emotions from our definition so we can get rid of similar pursuits,
but then we run the risk of banning also tragedies or sad movies.
How can we keep out this dark side to some human activities which is highly damaging to people,
and choose not to consider it art?

To help us out of this predicament let's look deeper into the "intentionality"
built into our definition.
Should art require two-way intentions,
so that the artist wants to transmit emotions **and** the audience wants to receive them?
This is an interesting question which probably needs more space to be answered.
As a quick note, some artists may abuse our confidence,
promising some emotions but then delivering in a completely unexpected way.
Gaspar No√© comes to mind as a famous director that makes
[shocking, controversial movies](https://goldenglobes.com/articles/gaspar-noe-on-why-he-does-not-want-to-make-shocking-movies-anymore/).

# ü§î Conclusion

Learn how to transmit feelings.
It is useful in many ways of life;
to artists it is essential.
