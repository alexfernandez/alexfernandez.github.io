Isaac Asimov introduced his [three laws of robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics)
in his 1941 story ['Runaround'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaround_(story)).
They are supposed to govern the behavior of robotic intelligences.
In short form:

1. Do not harm humans.
2. Obey orders from humans.
3. Protect yourself.

If you had to sketch three laws to direct human behavior,
what would they be?
I have given some thought to this matter lately.
What follows is my best attempt at sketching three sensible rules.

# üèòÔ∏è People over Things

We should always tend to people first,
before caring about things.
Let me tell you a short true story,
as told by a friend of mine.

She was visiting an American-Japanese girl, in their family house.
While she was there the mother of the family was cooking all their meals,
tending to their needs and caring about them in general.
Whenever they came home everything was ready for both of them.
My friend noticed the house had an amazing Japanese garden,
perfectly cared for.
She asked the mother:

'That garden is awesome! It must take a huge effort to care for it.'
'Yes', replied the mother: 'at least four or five hours a day'.
'I don't understand', my friend replied. 'You take care of us all day long.
How do you manage to tend to the garden as well?'
'Sure, but people should always take priority over things.
I will take care of the garden once you leave.'

This story is probably apocryphal:
my friend has later said she has no recolection of the matter.
But it illustrates the point well:
people are the most important aspect in our lives,
and they should take priority over everything else.

# üìã The Three Laws

These three laws should make us better people.

# Priorities

What priority should each law take?
Are they like Asimov's laws of robotics,
which must be followed in order?
I.e. the first law takes priority over the other two.

Only the canonical order leads to a balanced world; one leads to a frustrating world, another to a terrifying standoff, and the remaining three to killbot hellscapes.")

# ü§î Conclusion

Things are not a substitute for people, and they cannot be.
Once we have really intelligent robots they should probably still be
