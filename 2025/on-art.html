										<h1>üé® Advice to the Modern Artist</h1>
										<p>On Art in the Age of Artificial Intelligence<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Art in the era of oversupply, saturation, artificial intelligence
(AI) and large language models (LLMs) may look as a bleak endeavor:
isn‚Äôt everything said and done? Aren‚Äôt the machines copying everything
well enough so there is no place for the fledging artist? There is hope,
my human friends!</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-definition">üìñ A Brief Definition</h1>
<p>We will start with this working definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is any activity that transmits emotions among humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not simply making things up. The Cambridge dictionary defines <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/art">art</a>
as, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that
express feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to see that acting (as seen in theater and movies) falls
under this definition: actors and actresses try to display emotions,
which if properly done will carry over to the audience. Other forms of
art may not rely on empathy and therefore not be so immediate, but they
have in common that they stir something inside us.</p>
<h2 id="transmitted-feelings">Transmitted Feelings</h2>
<p>Feelings do not need to be profound. Works that depict still life or
daily routines can be awesome, and sometimes they may just be
aesthetically pleasing, which is certainly a feeling that we share when
contemplating them. These works do not need to be doing anything
else.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This aspect of aesthetic pleasure deserves some comment. While a
sunset can be beautiful and generate strong emotions (such as
peacefulness, serenity, beauty), it is not in itself artistic: there is
no transmission of emotions as we are just reacting to Nature. A
depiction of the same sunset in a painting or a photography however
becomes artistic, as those emotions are now transmitted from the person
that feels them in the first place to its audience. Such second-hand
feelings become embedded in those works.</p>
<p>There are also very complex sentiments that can be transmitted using
art. That feeling you get when you are broke and looking at expensive
things, the sensation of being watched over by a benevolent god-like
entity, the inimaginable anguish we get when do something irreparable
that isn‚Äôt even our fault. Complex story-telling is only one way of
getting these things across.</p>
<h2 id="arts-and-techniques">Arts and Techniques</h2>
<p>The purpose of many works of art across history has been simply to be
a vehicle so artists can show their craft. In painting this often goes
under the guise of depicting reality. ‚ÄúLook what awesome drawings I can
make‚Äù, Raffaello seems to be saying to Albrecht Durer in this stunning
study of two male figures.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/on-art-raphael-nude-studies.jpg"
title="Studies of two nude male figures drawn in red chalk."

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: <a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_-_Nude_Studies,_1515_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Google
Art Project via Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The text in the drawing, presumably written by Durer, <a
href="https://e-arthistory5.blogspot.com/2017/10/raphael-and-durer.html">actually
says</a> as translated by David Handforth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1515: Raphael of Urbino, who is so highly regarded by the Pope,
asserts that he has made this nude drawing and sent it to Albrecht
Duerer at Nuernberg in order to demonstrate to him his skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confusingly, the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars">latin
word <em>ars</em></a> means: ‚Äúart, skill, craft, handicraft‚Äù. We see
this meaning today in phrases as ‚Äúthe art of‚Ä¶‚Äù for some method or trade,
meant to teach how to do something which has no relation to the fine
arts.</p>
<p>We will stick to our definition. Great art is supposed to not just
depict reality, but convey strong emotions. Then why are skills
important? Good technique often helps ease the transmission of feelings.
Acting might be the most basic profession where you can just express a
sentiment and rely on empathy, and even so it is not enough. If nothing
else, skill is needed to create works of beauty.</p>
<h2 id="art-and-style">Art and Style</h2>
<p>Each artist has their own personal way of creating their works. It
serves as a kind of signature. Style is not necessarily important for
the transmission of feelings, though. Some artists even make a point of
being able to switch their ways freely. While a personal imprint can be
nice, it can also get in the way.</p>
<p>Actors sometimes complain that they are typecast in a kind of role,
for instance. The same can happen to many other artists if they
specialize too much. Artistic coherence is nice, but evolution as an
artist also requires modifying your style.</p>
<h1 id="the-miracle-of-art">The Miracle of Art</h1>
<p>The mere fact that feelings can be transmitted among humans is a
miracle. According to what I know my mind is a squishy mass enclosed in
a bone cage, that gets all its inputs from a bunch of wet cables. Can it
be that all outside things are just an illusion, and that I exist in
isolation imagining everything else? This fantasy has been <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism#History">paradoxically
shared since the times of Ancient Greece</a>. For instance Descartes
hypothesized that there was a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon">malicious demon</a>
feeding him images, to which his only escape was to imagine that God
would not let such demons ruin His creation.</p>
<p>What we observe is that many humans can easily made to react the same
way to the same stimulus. At a comedic monologue everyone laughs in
unison at the same time, with a comedian‚Äôs voice as only prompt. After a
sad movie many people will cry because they can be made to feel the
sadness of a loss. These are not isolated incidents.</p>
<p>But if we think about it, it is a miracle that this happens at all.
We all have different experiences and backgrounds. What is sad to some
can be enlightening to others. Even the experience of a color is
mediated by different relations between concepts: as I have explored in
<a
href="https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind#my-blue-and-your-blue">The
Amazing Mind</a>, my ‚Äúblue‚Äù is not your ‚Äúblue‚Äù and they can never be
equal since we don‚Äôt have the same relations in our brains.</p>
<p>How can works of art jump this schasm between our brains and reach
our inner emotions? We might advance some evolutionary explanation about
how shared feelings can be good for our survival, but this na√Øve sciency
babbling would offer at most some superficial comfort. I prefer to just
marvel at the fact that this happens at all. Even in our era of
hyper-saturation and deep cynicism we still carry open wounds that can
sometimes be activated by raw emotions. For our sake as humans, let it
continue to be so.</p>
<h1 id="ai-art">AI ‚ÄúArt‚Äù</h1>
<p>Our definition makes it clear that AI-generated images are not
really, and can never be, art: they don‚Äôt transmit feelings. Even the
most ardent proponents of an AI future cannot get over this basic fact:
machines don‚Äôt have any emotions to transmit.</p>
<p>LLMs are at their core just probabilistic generators. The fact that
our emotional machinery can be tricked by them is no wonder, as they are
built to statistically replicate our works of art. But they are often
repetitive, bland and lack depth.</p>
<p>The challenge of a modern artist can be seen as the creation of works
that AI cannot replicate, either because they are innovative or too far
out. I will stick to principle and say that the challenge continues to
be, as always has been, to stir emotions inside people.</p>
<h2 id="algorithmic-art">Algorithmic Art</h2>
<p>Being generated by a computer does not mean that it cannot transmit
feelings. Artists can use algorithms to find and replicate sequences
that create beautiful music. They can also filter the output of
generative algorithms and find hidden gems.</p>
<h1 id="artistic-categories">Artistic Categories</h1>
<p>Let‚Äôs now delve into the tricky world of categorizing art.</p>
<h2 id="fine-arts">Fine Arts</h2>
<p>The traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art">fine
arts</a> are: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, theatre
and dance. Of these, not all transmit feelings the same way.</p>
<p>Architecture creates living spaces.</p>
<h3 id="abstract-art">Abstract Art</h3>
<p>It is not clear how abstract art transmits whatever it is supposed to
be transmitting. Is it skill by the author, a complex technique or the
novelty of a new pattern? I must confess that I don‚Äôt get it.</p>
<p>It is true that music in its purest form (without words or voices) is
often seen as abstract. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreans</a>
wondered about the geometric nature of musical chords, found out
experimentally by plucking a string of different ratios. Why are some
chords sad, while others feel feisty? But the fact is that music can
transmit strong complex emotions. Film soundtracks are usually
instrumental, and they help carry the story forward to the point that
movies feel naked without them. On a more personal note, once I was
feeling nostalgic at a jazz guitar duo concert, only to learn later that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZitIqcdt8&amp;t=1611s">the
piece was called ‚ÄúNostalgia‚Äù</a>. I‚Äôm sure you have had similar
experiences.</p>
<p>While I would not consider instrumental music abstract, contemporary
compositions often feel like it. And to be honest I don‚Äôt get them
either. So how can composers and performers deliver raw feelings just
using different notes and chords? The answer is that since they are
human themselves, they can try different things and see how they make
themselves feel. Art through empathy is a powerful mechanism, and one
that is not available to artificial intelligence for obvious
reasons.</p>
<h2 id="modern-arts">Modern Arts</h2>
<p>Modern categories often include cinema, photography or comics.</p>
<p>What about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts">applied arts</a> like
design or decoration? According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects
aesthetically pleasing, which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does
therefore qualify under our definition.</p>
<p>There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions
and could be considered art. Let‚Äôs review a few of them.</p>
<h3 id="comedic-monologues">Comedic Monologues</h3>
<p>A category that transmits humor.</p>
<h3 id="computer-games">Computer Games</h3>
<p>The most consumed form of art nowadays, it is easy to create beauty,
strike fear, tell interesting and immersive stories.</p>
<h3 id="eroticism-and-pornography">Eroticism and Pornography</h3>
<p>Transmits feelings of sexual desire. There is little doubt that
erotic literature and cinema can be artistic, but pornography can be
quite controversial. It is quite explicit about transmitting feelings,
more specifically sexual arousal, but it is banned in many cultures and
poorly considered in many others. The figure below is from India, one of
the scarce cultures where pornography was acceptable in temples. (It‚Äôs
labeled ‚Äúerotic‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt fool anyone.)</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>Designed to stimulate feelings like cravings or desire. I don‚Äôt see
the fact that these works are done for crass commercial interests as a
demerit: or should Michelangelo be ashamed of accepting money for doing
propaganda for the strongest powers of his time, i.e.¬†kings and
popes?</p>
<h3 id="news">News</h3>
<p>Under the guise of reporting, these brave people will try to arouse
our interest, while sometimes scaring or delighting the audience. Their
serious countenance cannot distract us from the fact that they are often
dealing with raw emotions.</p>
<h3 id="influencing">Influencing</h3>
<p>These people know how to make you feel stuff. Be it beauty over
Instagram, amazement over YouTube, or rage over shitposting.</p>
<h3 id="other-arts">Other Arts</h3>
<p>Magic, illegal arts: confidence artistry, phishing.</p>
<h1 id="advice-to-the-modern-artist">Advice to the Modern Artist</h1>
<p>Focus on creating feelings. Technique, style, story telling, are all
means to an end. Learn to feel things yourself. Raw emotions are
hard.</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter that everything has been said 1000 times; audiences
will still feel horror when watching a modern performance of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex"><em>Oedipus
Rex</em></a>, premiered almost 2500 years ago. Incidentally is the
oldest crime mystery where the killer is revealed to be the
protagonist.</p>
<p>A singer that transmits their emotions in a live performance does not
need perfect pitch, autotune or a hundred synthesizers.</p>
<h2 id="result-not-process">Result not Process</h2>
<p>Focus on the result, and work backwards from there.</p>
<p>There are no cheap emotions, although there are shortcuts to get them
which make them feel cheap.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h1>
<p>I don‚Äôt have any particular credentials to speak about art, other
than I like to experience art. Sometimes I even create art in my own
<em>dilettante</em> fashion, like drawings or music. I also like
thinking hard about stuff, and don‚Äôt think that we should be limited in
the stuff that we give our opinion on. In any case, take my advice with
a grain of salt.</p>
