										<h1>üé® Advice to the Modern Artist</h1>
										<p>On Art in the Age of Artificial Intelligence<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Art in the era of oversupply, saturation, artificial intelligence
(AI) and large language models (LLMs) may look as a bleak endeavor:
isn‚Äôt everything said and done? Aren‚Äôt the machines copying everything
well enough so there is no place for the fledging artist? There is hope,
my human friends!</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-definition">üìñ A Brief Definition</h1>
<p>We will start with this working definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is any activity that transmits feelings among humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to see that acting (as seen in theater and movies) falls
under this definition: actors and actresses will display emotions, which
if properly done will carry over to the audience.</p>
<p>The Cambridge dictionary defines <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/art">art</a>
as, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that
express feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="arts-and-techniques">Arts and Techniques</h2>
<p>The purpose of many artists across history has been simply to show
their craft, under the guise of depicting reality. ‚ÄúLook what awesome
drawings I can make‚Äù, says Raffaello to Albrecht Durer in this <a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_-_Nude_Studies,_1515_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">stunning
study of two male figures</a>.</p>
<figure>

title="Studies of two nude male figures drawn in red chalk."
alt="Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: Google Art Project via Wikimedia." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source:
Google Art Project via Wikimedia.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The text (presumably written by Durer) <a
href="https://e-arthistory5.blogspot.com/2017/10/raphael-and-durer.html">actually
says</a>, as translated by David Handforth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1515: Raphael of Urbino, who is so highly regarded by the Pope,
asserts that he has made this nude drawing and sent it to Albrecht
Duerer at Nuernberg in order to demonstrate to him his skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confusingly, the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars">latin
word <em>ars</em></a> means: ‚Äúart, skill, craft, handicraft‚Äù. We see
this meaning today in phrases as ‚Äúthe art of‚Ä¶‚Äù for some method or trade,
meant to teach how to do something which has no relation to the fine
arts.</p>
<p>We will stick to our definition. Great art is supposed to not just
depict reality, but convey strong emotions. Works that depict still life
or daily routines can be awesome, but they are only great when they do
something else: in fact they give a deeper meaning to these otherwise
uninteresting moments.</p>

<h2 id="art-and-style">Art and Style</h2>
<p>Each artist has their own way of creating their works.</p>
<h1 id="the-miracle-of-art">The Miracle of Art</h1>
<p>The mere fact that feelings can be transmitted among humans is a
miracle. According to what I know my mind is a squishy mass enclosed in
a bone cage, that gets all its inputs from a bunch of wet cables. In
fact there is a persistent solipsistic fantasy that states that all
outside things are just an illusion, and that I exist in isolation
imagining everything else. For instance Descartes hypothesized that
there was a malicious demon feeding him images, to which his only escape
was to imagine that God would not let demons ruin His creation.</p>
<p>What we observe is that many humans can easily made to react the same
way to the same stimulus. At a comedic monologue everyone laughs in
unison at the same time, with a comedian‚Äôs voice as only prompt. After a
sad movie many people will cry because they can be made to feel the
sadness of a loss. These are not isolated incidents.</p>
<p>But if we think about it, it is a miracle that this happens at all.
We all have different experiences and backgrounds. What is sad to some
can be enlightening to others. Even the experience of a color is
mediated by different relations between concepts, as I have explored in
<a
href="https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind#my-blue-and-your-blue">The
Amazing Mind</a>: my ‚Äúblue‚Äù is not your ‚Äúblue‚Äù.</p>
<p>How can works of art jump this schasm between our brains and reach
our inner emotions? We might boldly advance some evolutionary
explanation about how shared feelings can be good for our survival, but
this modern sciency babbling would only offer some superficial comfort.
I prefer to just marvel at the fact that this happens at all. Even in
our era of hyper-saturation we still carry open wounds that can be
poisoned from the outside world.</p>
<h1 id="ai-art">AI ‚ÄúArt‚Äù</h1>
<p>Our definition makes it clear that AI-generated images are not
really, and can never be, art: they don‚Äôt transmit feelings. Even the
most ardent proponents of an AI future cannot get over this basic fact:
machines don‚Äôt have any emotions to transmit.</p>
<p>LLMs are at their core just probabilistic generators.</p>
<h2 id="algorithmic-music">Algorithmic Music</h2>
<p>Being generated by a computer does not mean that it cannot stir
emotions.</p>
<h1 id="artistic-categories">Artistic Categories</h1>
<p>The traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art">fine
arts</a> are: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, theatre
and dance. Modern categories often include cinema, comic and video
games. Of these, not all transmit feelings the same way.</p>
<p>Architecture creates living spaces.</p>
<p>What about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts">applied arts</a>?
According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects aesthetically
pleasing, which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does therefore
qualify under our definition.</p>
<p>But there are many other human activities that raise our inner
emotions and could be considered art. Let‚Äôs review a few of them.</p>
<p>Comedic monologues: a category that transmits humor.</p>
<p>Eroticism: transmits feelings of sexual desire. There is little
concern with erotic literature and cinema, but pornography can be quite
controversial. It is quite explicit about transmitting feelings,
especifically sexual arousal, but it is banned in many cultures and
poorly considered in many others.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Erotic_Kama_statues_of_Khajuraho_Hindu_Temple_de_Lakshmana_Khajur%C3%A2ho_India_2013.jpg">Erotic
Kama statues</a></p>
<p>Advertising: designed to create feelings, like cravings or
desire.</p>
<h1 id="advice-to-the-modern-artist">Advice to the Modern Artist</h1>
<p>Focus on creating feelings. Technique, style, story telling, are all
means to an end. Learn to feel things yourself. Raw emotions are
hard.</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter that everything has been said 1000 times; audiences
will still feel horror when watching a modern performance of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex"><em>Oedipus
Rex</em></a>, premiered almost 2500 years ago. Incidentally is the
oldest crime mystery where the killer is revealed to be the
protagonist.</p>
<p>A singer that transmits their emotions in a live performance does not
need perfect pitch, autotune or a hundred synthesizers.</p>
