										<h1>üé® Advice for the Modern Artist</h1>
										<p>On Art in the Age of Artificial Intelligence<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Art in our time may look like a bleak endeavor: in an era of
oversupply and saturation, isn‚Äôt everything said and done? And now with
artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) the
machines seem to be copying everything well enough; what place is left
for the fledging artist? There is hope, my human friends! Read on.</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-definition">üìñ A Brief Definition</h1>
<p>If you are like me, you may be thinking at this point: ‚ÄúBut, what can
be considered art in this day and age?‚Äù Let us start by establishing
this working definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is any activity that intentionally transmits emotions among
humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don‚Äôt trust me, which by the way I don‚Äôt see why you should,
let‚Äôs consult other sources. The Cambridge dictionary defines <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/art">art</a>
as, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that
express feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while The Britannica Dictionary <a
href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/art">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>something that is created with imagination and skill and that is
beautiful or that expresses important ideas or feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let‚Äôs go with our simpler statement and see where it takes us. It is
easy to see that acting (as seen in theater and movies) falls under this
definition: practitioners display a range of emotions which, when
properly done, will carry over to the audience. Other forms of art may
not rely on direct empathy and therefore they are less immediate, but
they have in common that they stir something inside us.</p>
<h2 id="transmitted-emotions">Transmitted Emotions</h2>
<p>Feelings transmitted by art do not need to be profound: works that
depict still life or daily routines can be awesome. Sometimes they may
just be aesthetically pleasing, which is certainly a feeling that we
share when contemplating them. These works do not need to be doing
anything else.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/on-art-vieja-friendo-huevos.jpg"

(<em>Vieja friendo huevos</em>). Source: <a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vieja_friendo_huevos,_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg">Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This aspect of aesthetic pleasure deserves some comment. While a
sunset can be beautiful and generate strong emotions (such as
peacefulness, serenity, beauty), it is not in itself artistic: there is
no transmission of emotions as we are just reacting to Nature. A
depiction of the same sunset in a painting or a photography however
becomes artistic, as those emotions are now transmitted from the person
that feels them in the first place to the spectators. Such second-hand
feelings become embedded in those works.</p>
<p>There are also very complex sentiments that can be transmitted using
art. That feeling you get when you are broke and looking at expensive
things, the sensation of being watched over by a benevolent god-like
entity that doesn‚Äôt care about you, the inexplicable anguish we get when
we see something irreparable that isn‚Äôt even our fault. Complex
story-telling is but one way of transmitting such sophisticated
emotions; some really good works of art can do it with seemingly
unrelated elements, like musical chord sequences or an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblage_(art)">assemblage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="intentionality">Intentionality</h2>
<p>A quick note on intention: in order to qualify as art, the artist has
to <em>want</em> to transmit a certain emotion. If someone is just sad
and watching them makes other people feel sad, or if an artist wants to
transmit one thing but then conveys another, then it falls out of scope.
For instance, a movie director might want to create a work of horror and
science fiction, but accidentally make the audience feel vicarious shame
and laugh at it.</p>
<figure>

title="Poster for the movie &#39;Plan 9 from Outer Space&#39;, showing the title in bold red letters. Also in red a masculine protagonist and Vampira, a vampire lady. In the background are figher jets, grave diggers and some kind of crazy scientist. Most of these things do not appear in the movie at all, honestly."

</figure>
<p>Many human activities make us feel emotions. For instance a well
designed and written software program may fill us with joy. But when its
intent is mainly functional we will not consider it ‚Äúa work of art‚Äù. It
is possible to write code with the purpose of making it beautiful, and
in this case we may well consider it artistic.</p>
<h2 id="arts-and-techniques">Arts and Techniques</h2>
<p>Speaking about purpose: the intention of many works of art across
history has been simply to be a vehicle so artists can show their craft.
In painting this often goes under the guise of depicting reality. ‚ÄúLook
what awesome drawings I can do‚Äù, Raffaello seems to be saying in this
stunning study of two male figures he sent to Albrecht D√ºrer.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/on-art-raphael-nude-studies.jpg"
title="Studies of two nude male figures drawn in red chalk."
alt="Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: Google Art Project via Wikimedia." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: <a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_-_Nude_Studies,_1515_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Google
Art Project via Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The text in the drawing, presumably written by D√ºrer, <a
href="https://e-arthistory5.blogspot.com/2017/10/raphael-and-durer.html">actually
says</a> as translated by David Handforth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1515: Raphael of Urbino, who is so highly regarded by the Pope,
asserts that he has made this nude drawing and sent it to Albrecht
Duerer at Nuernberg in order to demonstrate to him his skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confusingly, the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars">latin
word <em>ars</em></a> means: ‚Äúart, skill, craft, handicraft‚Äù. We see
this meaning today in phrases as ‚Äúthe art of‚Ä¶‚Äù, often used to teach a
trade or method which has no relation to any emotions. Should we also
consider this aspect of art?</p>
<p>We will stick to our definition. Great art is supposed to not just
depict reality, but convey strong emotions. Then why are skills
important? Good technique often eases the transmission of feelings.
Acting might be the most basic profession where you can just express a
sentiment and rely on empathy, and reaching across to the audience still
requires lots of talent and preparation. If nothing else, skill is
needed to create works of beauty.</p>
<h1 id="the-miracle-of-art">The Miracle of Art</h1>
<p>The mere fact that feelings can be transmitted among humans is a
miracle. To the best of my knowledge my mind is a squishy mass enclosed
in a bone cage, that gets all its inputs from a bunch of wet cables. Can
it be that all outside things are just an illusion, and that I exist in
isolation imagining everything else? This fantasy has been <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism#History">paradoxically
shared since the times of Ancient Greece</a>. A few centuries later
Descartes hypothesized that there might be a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon">malicious demon</a>
feeding him all perceptions, to which there was hardly any escape. The
modern version would be that we live in a <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2021/understanding-simulation">computer
simulation</a>. In any of these scenarios the transmission of feelings
would be nonsensical, a lost cause.</p>

</figure>
<p>Let‚Äôs suppose that we somehow live in the world that we perceive.
What we observe is that many humans can easily made to react in a
similar way to the same stimulus. At a comedic monologue everyone laughs
in unison at the same time, with a comedian‚Äôs voice as only prompt.
After a good sad movie many people will cry because they can be made to
understand the drama. These are not isolated incidents.</p>
<p>But if we think about it, it is a miracle that this happens at all.
We all have different experiences and backgrounds. What is sad to some
can be enlightening to others. Even the experience of a color is
mediated by different relations between concepts: as I have explored in
<a
href="https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind#my-blue-and-your-blue">The
Amazing Mind</a>, my ‚Äúblue‚Äù is not your ‚Äúblue‚Äù and they can never be
equal: we don‚Äôt have the exact same concepts or relationships in our
brains.</p>
<p>How can works of art jump the chasm across brains and reach our inner
emotions? We might advance some evolutionary explanation about how
shared feelings can be good for our survival as a species, but this
na√Øve sciency babbling can offer at most some superficial comfort. I
prefer to just marvel at the fact that this happens at all. Even in our
era of hyper-saturation and deep cynicism we still carry open wounds
that can sometimes be activated by raw emotions. For our sake as humans,
let us hope it continues to be so.</p>
<h1 id="artificial-art">Artificial ‚ÄúArt‚Äù</h1>
<p>Today the field of AI is full of very sophisticated generative models
that can create complex images and even videos in seconds. But are they
really artistic? Our definition makes it clear that any works generated
by AI are not really, and can never be, art: they cannot transmit
emotions, as computers cannot be made to have feelings; at least at this
point in time. Even the most ardent proponents of an AI future cannot
get over this basic fact.</p>
<p>LLMs and generative models are at their core just probabilistic
generators. The fact that our emotional machinery can be tricked by them
is no wonder, as they are built to statistically replicate our works of
art. But they are often repetitive, bland and lack depth. However,
humans can refine the input and filter the output of generative models
until they find those that are effective in conveying emotion. It would
not be so different from a photographer picking the right perspective
and angle to capture a beautiful sunset.</p>
<figure>

title="A colorful image of a boat in a lake with a sunset in the back."

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">‚ÄòAlmer√≠a 1‚Äô, generated by AI. Source:

</figure>
<p>How can modern artists thrive with such faithful generators? The
powers of extrapolation of generative models are in fact quite limited.
The challenge can be seen as the creation of works that AI cannot
replicate, either because they are innovative or too far out.</p>
<p>But I will venture to go against the grain: I believe that innovation
is not really the point. If we stick to principle we can say that the
challenge continues to be, as always has been, to stir emotions inside
people.</p>
<h2 id="algorithmic-art">Algorithmic Art</h2>
<p>A work being generated by a computer does not mean that it cannot
transmit feelings. Artists can use algorithms to find and replicate
sequences that create beautiful music, for instance. They can also
create beautiful patterns with a few lines of code, or with some basic
programming. In these cases it is the person behind the program (or the
controls, or the algorithms) that is doing the transmission.</p>
<h1 id="some-advice">Some Advice</h1>
<p>At this point we are ready to extract some lessons. An artist should
always <strong>focus on creating feelings</strong>. Technique, style,
story telling, are all means to an end. To achieve this you should learn
to feel things yourself. Keep in mind that raw emotions are hard, and
the process of exposing them is even harder.</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter that everything has been said 1000 times; audiences
can still feel the anguish when watching a modern performance of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex"><em>Oedipus
Rex</em></a>, premiered almost 2500 years ago. Spoilers ahead: everyone
remembers that Oedipus killed his own father and slept with his own
mother, but it is indeed the first preserved thriller. We follow the
crime investigation where he tries to find the killer of his predecessor
as king, only to learn that Oedipus himself was the killer and that the
guy was his father. This theme is used in (more spoilers) <a
href="https://screenrant.com/great-movies-hero-killer-all-along/">these
ten movies</a>: apparently every generation has to rediscover the story
where the hero turns out to be the killer.</p>
<figure>

<p>A singer that transmits their emotions in a live performance does not
need perfect pitch, autotune or a hundred synthesizers. On the other
hand audiences tend to get bored and require some degree of novelty too,
and there are fashions in art which can make feelings more powerful.
Alternatively, not keeping up with trends can make audiences
disengage.</p>
<h2 id="result-not-process">Result not Process</h2>
<p>Established processes to create impactful art are too prone to fall
into the mindless formula, like TV movies or elevator music: bland
feelings at best, poor . Instead you should focus on the result and work
backwards from there. If you have something to express look for the most
effective way of achieving it.</p>
<p>There are no cheap emotions, although there are shortcuts to express
them which make them feel cheap. People like to think they have earned
their right to their feelings. Just putting things out there is not
enough: as we have seen skill and technique are crucial to deliver
properly.</p>
<h2 id="art-and-style">Art and Style</h2>
<p>Each artist has their own personal way of creating their works. It
serves as a kind of signature. Style is not necessarily important for
the transmission of feelings, though. Some artists even make a point of
being able to switch their ways freely.</p>
<p>While a personal imprint can be nice, it can also get in the way.
Actors sometimes complain that they are typecast in a kind of role, for
instance. The same can happen to many other artists if they specialize
too much. Artistic coherence is nice, but evolution as an artist may
also require modifying your style.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/on-art-bosch-saint-john.jpg"
alt="Many classic painters have really defined styles, such as the oniric images that Hieronymus Bosch displays in this work: Saint John the Baptist in the Desert. Source: Google Art Project via Wikimedia." />

</figure>
<p>To the point that style is unavoidable, just embrace it. But it can
be worth your time to venture out of your own personality. For many
artists their egos can become a problem: for some reason, staying in
touch with your inner feelings and being able to project them to others
make people believe they are more important than the rest. Being able to
keep your ego within checks is a valuable asset in your career.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>I don‚Äôt have any particular credentials to speak about art, other
than I like to experience and enjoy it. Sometimes I even create art in
my own <em>dilettante</em> fashion, like drawings or music, never very
good to be honest. I also like thinking hard about things that I find
interesting, and don‚Äôt think that we should be limited to give our
opinion on matters outside our experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is usually more interesting to listen to
experts. I just think that in this area the artists themselves are too
lost in the process, and do not try to derive their advice from first
principles. That is why I started with a very simple premise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is any activity that intentionally transmits emotions among
humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And worked my way from there. In any case, take my advice with a
grain of salt.</p>
<h1 id="artistic-categories">Artistic Categories</h1>
<p>What particular area of expertise should the fledging artist choose?
There are more than you think. Let‚Äôs now delve into the tricky world of
categorizing art.</p>
<h2 id="fine-arts">Fine Arts</h2>
<p>The traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art">fine
arts</a> are according to Wikipedia: painting, sculpture, architecture,
music, poetry, theatre and dance.</p>
<p>One of these sticks out as being particularly inefficient for the
tranmission of sentiments. Architecture creates living spaces, it can
create and express beauty, but the range of emotions that it can express
is severely limited. When a construction is more functional than
artistic, can it be said to be art? There are still surprising
findings.</p>

TxllxT via Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="abstract-art">Abstract Art</h3>
<p>It is not clear how abstract art transmits whatever it is supposed to
be transmitting. Is it just displaying skill by the author, a complex
technique or the novelty of a new pattern? I must confess that quite
often I don‚Äôt get it, and so seem to do most people as it has never
gained widespread acceptance. I can also feel some suppressed emotions
sometimes with exceptional works.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It is true that music in its purest form (without words or voices) is
often seen as abstract. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreans</a>
wondered about the geometric nature of musical chords, found out
experimentally by plucking a string of different ratios. Why are some
chords sad, while others feel feisty? But the fact is that music can
transmit strong complex emotions. Film soundtracks are usually
instrumental, and they help carry the story forward to the point that
movies feel naked without them. On a more personal note, once I was
feeling nostalgic at a jazz guitar duo concert, only to learn later that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZitIqcdt8&amp;t=1611s">the
piece was called ‚ÄúNostalgia‚Äù</a>. I‚Äôm sure you have had similar
experiences.</p>
<p>While I would not consider instrumental music abstract, contemporary
compositions often feel like it. And to be honest I don‚Äôt get them
either. So how can composers and performers deliver raw feelings just
using different notes and chords? The answer is that since they are
human themselves, they can try different things and see how they make
themselves feel. Art through empathy is a powerful mechanism, and one
that is not available to artificial intelligence for obvious
reasons.</p>
<h2 id="modern-arts">Modern Arts</h2>
<p>Modern categories often include cinema, photography and comics.</p>
<p>What about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts">applied arts</a> like
design or decoration? According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects
aesthetically pleasing, which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does
therefore qualify under our definition.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions
and could be considered art. Let‚Äôs review a few of them, starting with
the most obvious and going deeper with fringe acts.</p>
<h3 id="computer-games">Computer Games</h3>
<p>The most consumed form of art nowadays, it is easy to create beauty,
strike fear, tell interesting and immersive stories.</p>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>Designed to stimulate feelings like cravings or desire. I don‚Äôt see
the fact that these works are done for crass commercial interests as a
demerit: or should Michelangelo be ashamed of accepting money for doing
propaganda for the strongest powers of his time, i.e.¬†kings and
popes?</p>
<h3 id="comedic-monologues">Comedic Monologues</h3>
<p>A category that transmits humor.</p>
<h3 id="eroticism-and-pornography">Eroticism and Pornography</h3>
<p>Transmits feelings of sexual desire. There is little doubt that
erotic literature and cinema can be artistic, but pornography can be
quite controversial. It is banned in many cultures and poorly considered
in many others. The difference seems to be the open depiction of
genitals and sexual acts.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that there are many such images in India, like
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Erotic_Kama_statues_of_Khajuraho_Hindu_Temple_de_Lakshmana_Khajur%C3%A2ho_India_2013.jpg">Kama
statues from Khajur√¢ho temple (NSFW)</a>. Below is an example of a less
known trend: pornographic figures in Christian Romanesque temples from
the 11th century. (They are usually labeled ‚Äúerotic‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt fool
anyone.)</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Porn is quite explicit about transmitting feelings, more specifically
sexual arousal, so it would meet our definition of art. I can hardly
recommend anyone to devote their careers to erotic or porn modelling, as
it is really limiting artistically.</p>
<h3 id="news">News</h3>
<p>Under the guise of reporting, these brave people will try to arouse
our interest, while sometimes scaring or delighting the audience. Their
serious countenance cannot distract us from the fact that they are often
dealing with raw emotions.</p>
<h3 id="influencing">Influencing</h3>
<p>These people know how to make you feel stuff. Be it beauty over

<p>Feeding people is not the point. A good meal can make you feel a
range of experiences.</p>

<p>The ancient term <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> is described
in the Wikipedia page as ‚Äúthe art of persuasion‚Äù. It is really useful to
explain things to others so that they see them as advantageous. The
classic philosopher Socrates despised sophists since they learned to
defend both sides of an argument. But contemplating different points of
view can open your mind and widen your horizons.</p>

<p>Going by our definition alone, we could think that there are
malicious activities which should be considered artistic. A synonym for
a scammer is ‚Äúcon artist‚Äù, or confidence trickster. In a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam">scam</a> you have to make the
victim, or ‚Äúmark‚Äù, feel confidence. Similarly in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> and other
forms of social engineering.</p>
<p>There are even worse activities like abuse or mobbing, where the
victim is made to feel miserable. I don‚Äôt think anyone sane would want
to call them arts even though there is transmission of emotions. We may
feel tempted to exclude negative emotions from our definition so we can
get rid of similar pursuits, but then we run the risk of banning also
tragedies or sad movies. We may prefer to realize that there is a dark
side to some human activities which is highly damaging to people, and
choose not to consider it art.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h1>
<p>Learn how to transmit feelings. It is useful in many ways of life; to
artists it is essential.</p>
