										<h1>üé® Advice to the Modern Artist</h1>
										<p>On Art in the Age of Artificial Intelligence<p>
									</header>
																				<p>Art in our time may look like a bleak endeavor: in an era of
oversupply and saturation, isn‚Äôt everything said and done? And now with
artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) the
machines seem to be copying everything well enough; what place is left
for the fledging artist? There is hope, my human friends! Read on.</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-definition">üìñ A Brief Definition</h1>
<p>If you are like me, you may be thinking at this point: ‚ÄúBut, what can
be considered art in this day and age?‚Äù Let us start by establishing
this working definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is any activity that intentionally transmits emotions among
humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don‚Äôt trust me, which by the way I don‚Äôt see why you should,
let‚Äôs consult other sources. The Cambridge dictionary defines <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/art">art</a>
as, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that
express feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while The Britannica Dictionary <a
href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/art">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>something that is created with imagination and skill and that is
beautiful or that expresses important ideas or feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let‚Äôs go with our simpler statement and see where it takes us. It is
easy to see that acting (as seen in theater and movies) falls under this
definition: practitioners display a range of emotions which, when
properly done, will carry over to the audience. Other forms of art may
not rely on direct empathy and therefore they are less immediate, but
they have in common that they stir something inside us.</p>
<h2 id="transmitted-emotions">Transmitted Emotions</h2>
<p>Feelings transmitted by art do not need to be profound: works that
depict still life or daily routines can be awesome. Sometimes they may
just be aesthetically pleasing, which is certainly a feeling that we
share when contemplating them. These works do not need to be doing
anything else.</p>
<figure>

(<em>Vieja friendo huevos</em>). Source: <a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vieja_friendo_huevos,_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg">Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This aspect of aesthetic pleasure deserves some comment. While a
sunset can be beautiful and generate strong emotions (such as
peacefulness, serenity, beauty), it is not in itself artistic: there is
no transmission of emotions as we are just reacting to Nature. A
depiction of the same sunset in a painting or a photography however
becomes artistic, as those emotions are now transmitted from the person
that feels them in the first place to the spectators. Such second-hand
feelings become embedded in those works.</p>
<p>There are also very complex sentiments that can be transmitted using
art. That feeling you get when you are broke and looking at expensive
things, the sensation of being watched over by a benevolent god-like
entity that doesn‚Äôt care about you, the inexplicable anguish we get when
we see something irreparable that isn‚Äôt even our fault. Complex
story-telling is but one way of transmitting such sophisticated
emotions; some really good works of art can do it with seemingly
unrelated elements, like musical chord sequences or an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblage_(art)">assemblage</a>.</p>
<h2 id="intentionality">Intentionality</h2>
<p>A quick note on intention: in order to qualify as art, the artist has
to <em>want</em> to transmit a certain emotion. If someone is just sad
and watching them makes other people feel sad, or if an artist wants to
transmit one thing but then conveys another, then it falls out of scope.
For instance, a movie director might want to create a work of horror and
science fiction, but accidentally make the audience feel vicarious shame
and laugh at it.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plan_9_Alternative_poster.jpg">Plan
9</a>.</p>
<p>Many human activities make us feel emotions. For instance a well
designed and written software program may fill us with joy. But when its
intent is mainly functional we will not consider it ‚Äúa work of art‚Äù. It
is possible to write code with the purpose of making it beautiful, and
in this case we may well consider it artistic.</p>
<h2 id="arts-and-techniques">Arts and Techniques</h2>
<p>The purpose of many works of art across history has been simply to be
a vehicle so artists can show their craft. In painting this often goes
under the guise of depicting reality. ‚ÄúLook what awesome drawings I can
make‚Äù, Raffaello seems to be saying to Albrecht Durer in this stunning
study of two male figures.</p>
<figure>
<img src="pics/on-art-raphael-nude-studies.jpg"
title="Studies of two nude male figures drawn in red chalk."
alt="Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: Google Art Project via Wikimedia." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: <a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_-_Nude_Studies,_1515_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Google
Art Project via Wikimedia</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The text in the drawing, presumably written by Durer, <a
href="https://e-arthistory5.blogspot.com/2017/10/raphael-and-durer.html">actually
says</a> as translated by David Handforth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1515: Raphael of Urbino, who is so highly regarded by the Pope,
asserts that he has made this nude drawing and sent it to Albrecht
Duerer at Nuernberg in order to demonstrate to him his skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confusingly, the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars">latin
word <em>ars</em></a> means: ‚Äúart, skill, craft, handicraft‚Äù. We see
this meaning today in phrases as ‚Äúthe art of‚Ä¶‚Äù for some method or trade,
meant to teach how to do something which has no relation to the fine
arts.</p>
<p>We will stick to our definition. Great art is supposed to not just
depict reality, but convey strong emotions. Then why are skills
important? Good technique often helps ease the transmission of feelings.
Acting might be the most basic profession where you can just express a
sentiment and rely on empathy, and even so it is not enough. If nothing
else, skill is needed to create works of beauty.</p>
<h1 id="the-miracle-of-art">The Miracle of Art</h1>
<p>The mere fact that feelings can be transmitted among humans is a
miracle. According to what I know my mind is a squishy mass enclosed in
a bone cage, that gets all its inputs from a bunch of wet cables. Can it
be that all outside things are just an illusion, and that I exist in
isolation imagining everything else? This fantasy has been <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism#History">paradoxically
shared since the times of Ancient Greece</a>. For instance Descartes
hypothesized that there was a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon">malicious demon</a>
feeding him all perceptions, to which there was hardly any escape. The
modern version would be that we live in a <a
href="https://pinchito.es/2021/understanding-simulation">computer
simulation</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Let‚Äôs suppose that we somehow live in the world that we perceive.
What we observe is that many humans can easily made to react the same
way to the same stimulus. At a comedic monologue everyone laughs in
unison at the same time, with a comedian‚Äôs voice as only prompt. After a
good sad movie many people will cry because they can be made to feel the
sadness. These are not isolated incidents.</p>
<p>But if we think about it, it is a miracle that this happens at all.
We all have different experiences and backgrounds. What is sad to some
can be enlightening to others. Even the experience of a color is
mediated by different relations between concepts: as I have explored in
<a
href="https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind#my-blue-and-your-blue">The
Amazing Mind</a>, my ‚Äúblue‚Äù is not your ‚Äúblue‚Äù and they can never be
equal since we don‚Äôt have the exact same concepts in our brains.</p>
<p>How can works of art jump the chasm among brains and reach our inner
emotions? We might advance some evolutionary explanation about how
shared feelings can be good for our survival, but this na√Øve sciency
babbling can offer at most some superficial comfort. I prefer to just
marvel at the fact that this happens at all. Even in our era of
hyper-saturation and deep cynicism we still carry open wounds that can
sometimes be activated by raw emotions. For our sake as humans, let us
hope it continues to be so.</p>
<h1 id="artificial-art">Artificial ‚ÄúArt‚Äù</h1>
<p>Today the field of AI is full of very sophisticated generative models
that can create complex images and even videos in seconds. But are they
really artistic? Our definition makes it clear that any works generated
by AI are not really, and can never be, art: they cannot transmit
emotions as computers cannot be made to feel. Even the most ardent
proponents of an AI future cannot get over this basic fact.</p>
<p>LLMs and generative models are at their core just probabilistic
generators. The fact that our emotional machinery can be tricked by them
is no wonder, as they are built to statistically replicate our works of
art. But they are often repetitive, bland and lack depth.</p>
<p>An artist can filter the output of generative models and find those
that are effective in conveying emotion.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Rafael Molina. Source: <a href="">Rafael
Molina</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The challenge of a modern artist can be seen as the creation of works
that AI cannot replicate, either because they are innovative or too far
out. I will stick to principle and say that the challenge continues to
be, as always has been, to stir emotions inside people. Innovation is
not the point.</p>
<h2 id="algorithmic-art">Algorithmic Art</h2>
<p>Being generated by a computer does not mean that it cannot transmit
feelings. Artists can use algorithms to find and replicate sequences
that create beautiful music.</p>
<h1 id="advice-to-the-modern-artist">Advice to the Modern Artist</h1>
<p>At this point we are ready to extract some conclusions. Focus on
creating feelings. Technique, style, story telling, are all means to an
end. Learn to feel things yourself. Raw emotions are hard.</p>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter that everything has been said 1000 times; audiences
can still feel the anguish when watching a modern performance of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex"><em>Oedipus
Rex</em></a>, premiered almost 2500 years ago. Spoilers ahead: every
generation has to rediscover the mystery thriller where the killer is
finally revealed to be the protagonist, like in <a
href="https://screenrant.com/great-movies-hero-killer-all-along/">these
ten movies</a>. (Incidentally, <em>Oedipus Rex</em> did it first.)</p>
<p>A singer that transmits their emotions in a live performance does not
need perfect pitch, autotune or a hundred synthesizers. On the other
hand audiences tend to get bored and require some degree of novelty
too.</p>
<h2 id="result-not-process">Result not Process</h2>
<p>Focus on the result, and work backwards from there.</p>
<p>There are no cheap emotions, although there are shortcuts to get them
which make them feel cheap. People like to think they have earned their
right to their feelings.</p>
<h2 id="art-and-style">Art and Style</h2>
<p>Each artist has their own personal way of creating their works. It
serves as a kind of signature. Style is not necessarily important for
the transmission of feelings, though. Some artists even make a point of
being able to switch their ways freely. While a personal imprint can be
nice, it can also get in the way.</p>
<p>Actors sometimes complain that they are typecast in a kind of role,
for instance. The same can happen to many other artists if they
specialize too much. Artistic coherence is nice, but evolution as an
artist also requires modifying your style.</p>
<p><a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hieronymus_Bosch_-_Saint_John_the_Baptist_in_the_Desert_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">El
Bosco</a></p>
<p>To the point that style is unavoidable, just embrace it. But it can
be worth your time to venture out of your own personality.</p>
<p>For many artists their egos can become a problem: for some reason,
staying in touch with your inner feelings and being able to project them
to others make people believe they are more important than the rest.
Being able to keep your ego within checks is a valuable asset in your
career.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>I don‚Äôt have any particular credentials to speak about art, other
than I like to experience and enjoy it. Sometimes I even create art in
my own <em>dilettante</em> fashion, like drawings or music. I also like
thinking hard about things that I find interesting, and don‚Äôt think that
we should be limited to give our opinion on matters outside our
experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand it is usually interesting to listen to experts. In
any case, take my advice with a grain of salt.</p>
<h1 id="artistic-categories">Artistic Categories</h1>
<p>What particular area of expertise should the fledging artist choose?
There are more than you think. Let‚Äôs now delve into the tricky world of
categorizing art.</p>
<h2 id="fine-arts">Fine Arts</h2>
<p>The traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art">fine
arts</a> are: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, theatre
and dance. Of these, not all transmit feelings the same way.</p>
<p>Architecture creates living spaces.</p>
<h3 id="abstract-art">Abstract Art</h3>
<p>It is not clear how abstract art transmits whatever it is supposed to
be transmitting. Is it skill by the author, a complex technique or the
novelty of a new pattern? I must confess that I don‚Äôt get it, and so
seem to do most people as it has never gained widespread acceptance.</p>
<p>It is true that music in its purest form (without words or voices) is
often seen as abstract. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreans</a>
wondered about the geometric nature of musical chords, found out
experimentally by plucking a string of different ratios. Why are some
chords sad, while others feel feisty? But the fact is that music can
transmit strong complex emotions. Film soundtracks are usually
instrumental, and they help carry the story forward to the point that
movies feel naked without them. On a more personal note, once I was
feeling nostalgic at a jazz guitar duo concert, only to learn later that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZitIqcdt8&amp;t=1611s">the
piece was called ‚ÄúNostalgia‚Äù</a>. I‚Äôm sure you have had similar
experiences.</p>
<p>While I would not consider instrumental music abstract, contemporary
compositions often feel like it. And to be honest I don‚Äôt get them
either. So how can composers and performers deliver raw feelings just
using different notes and chords? The answer is that since they are
human themselves, they can try different things and see how they make
themselves feel. Art through empathy is a powerful mechanism, and one
that is not available to artificial intelligence for obvious
reasons.</p>
<h2 id="modern-arts">Modern Arts</h2>
<p>Modern categories often include cinema, photography or comics.</p>
<p>What about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts">applied arts</a> like
design or decoration? According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects
aesthetically pleasing, which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does
therefore qualify under our definition.</p>
<p>There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions
and could be considered art. Let‚Äôs review a few of them, starting with
the most obvious and going deeper with fringe acts.</p>
<h3 id="computer-games">Computer Games</h3>
<p>The most consumed form of art nowadays, it is easy to create beauty,
strike fear, tell interesting and immersive stories.</p>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>Designed to stimulate feelings like cravings or desire. I don‚Äôt see
the fact that these works are done for crass commercial interests as a
demerit: or should Michelangelo be ashamed of accepting money for doing
propaganda for the strongest powers of his time, i.e.¬†kings and
popes?</p>
<h3 id="comedic-monologues">Comedic Monologues</h3>
<p>A category that transmits humor.</p>
<h3 id="eroticism-and-pornography">Eroticism and Pornography</h3>
<p>Transmits feelings of sexual desire. There is little doubt that
erotic literature and cinema can be artistic, but pornography can be
quite controversial. It is quite explicit about transmitting feelings,
more specifically sexual arousal, but it is banned in many cultures and
poorly considered in many others. The figure below is from India, one of
the scarce cultures where pornography was acceptable in temples. (It‚Äôs
labeled ‚Äúerotic‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt fool anyone.)</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="news">News</h3>
<p>Under the guise of reporting, these brave people will try to arouse
our interest, while sometimes scaring or delighting the audience. Their
serious countenance cannot distract us from the fact that they are often
dealing with raw emotions.</p>
<h3 id="influencing">Influencing</h3>
<p>These people know how to make you feel stuff. Be it beauty over
Instagram, amazement over YouTube, or rage over shitposting.</p>
<h3 id="gastronomy">Gastronomy</h3>
<p>Feeding people is not the point. A good meal can make you feel a
range of experiences.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>The ancient term <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> is described
in the Wikipedia page as ‚Äúthe art of persuasion‚Äù. It is really useful to
explain things to others so that they see them as advantageous. The
classic philosopher Socrates despised sophists since they learned to
defend both sides of an argument. But contemplating different points of
view can open your mind and widen your horizons.</p>
<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
<p>Magic makes you feel wonder.</p>
<h3 id="the-dark-arts">The Dark Arts</h3>
<p>Going by our definition alone, we could think that there are
malicious activities which should be considered artistic. A synonym for
a scammer is ‚Äúcon artist‚Äù, or confidence trickster. In a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam">scam</a> you have to make the
victim, or ‚Äúmark‚Äù, feel confidence. Similarly in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> and other
forms of social engineering.</p>
<p>There are even worse activities like abuse or mobbing, where the
victim is made to feel miserable. I don‚Äôt think anyone sane would want
to call them arts even though there is transmission of emotions. We may
feel tempted to exclude negative emotions from our definition so we can
get rid of similar pursuits, but then we run the risk of banning also
tragedies or sad movies. We may prefer to realize that there is a dark
side to some human activities which is highly damaging to people, and
choose not to consider it art.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">ü§î Conclusion</h1>
<p>Learn how to transmit feelings. It is useful in many ways of life; to
artists it is essential.</p>
