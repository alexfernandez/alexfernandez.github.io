Art in the era of oversupply, saturation,
artificial intelligence (AI)
and large language models (LLMs) may look as a bleak endeavor:
isn't everything said and done?
Aren't the machines copying everything well enough so there is no place for the fledging artist?
There is hope, my human friends!

# üìñ A Brief Definition

We will start with this working definition:

> Art is any activity that transmits feelings among humans.

It is easy to see that acting (as seen in theater and movies) falls under this definition:
actors and actresses will display emotions,
which if properly done will carry over to the audience.

The Cambridge dictionary defines [art](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/art) as, among other things:

> the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that express feelings.

## Arts and Techniques

The purpose of many artists across history has been simply to show their craft,
under the guise of depicting reality.
"Look what awesome drawings I can make", says Raffaello to Albrecht Durer in this
[stunning study of two male figures](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_-_Nude_Studies,_1515_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg).

![Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: Google Art Project via Wikimedia.](pics/on-art-raphael-nude-studies.jpg "Studies of two nude male figures drawn in red chalk.")

The text (presumably written by Durer) [actually says](https://e-arthistory5.blogspot.com/2017/10/raphael-and-durer.html), as translated by David Handforth:

> 1515: Raphael of Urbino, who is so highly regarded by the Pope, asserts that he has made this nude drawing and sent it to Albrecht Duerer at Nuernberg in order to demonstrate to him his skill.

Confusingly, the [latin word _ars_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars) means: "art, skill, craft, handicraft".
We see this meaning today in phrases as "the art of..." for some method or trade,
meant to teach how to do something which has no relation to the fine arts.

We will stick to our definition.
Great art is supposed to not just depict reality,
but convey strong emotions.

## Other Artistic Meanderings

Works that depict still life or daily routines can be awesome,
but they are only great when they do something else:
in fact they give a deeper meaning to these otherwise uninteresting moments.
Aesthetically pleasing.

This aspect of aesthetic pleasure deserves some comment.
While a sunset can be beautiful and generate strong emotions,
it is not in itself artistic,
as there is no transmission of emotions:
we are just reacting to Nature.

A depiction of the same sunset in a painting or a photography can however be artistic
as those emotions are now transmitted from the person that feels them in the first place to its audience,
in a second-hand fashion.

## Art and Style

Each artist has their own way of creating their works.

# The Miracle of Art

The mere fact that feelings can be transmitted among humans is a miracle.
According to what I know my mind is a squishy mass enclosed in a bone cage,
that gets all its inputs from a bunch of wet cables.
In fact there is a persistent solipsistic fantasy that states that all outside things are just an illusion,
and that I exist in isolation imagining everything else.
For instance Descartes hypothesized that there was a malicious demon feeding him images,
to which his only escape was to imagine that God would not let demons ruin His creation.

What we observe is that many humans can easily made to react the same way to the same stimulus.
At a comedic monologue everyone laughs in unison at the same time,
with a comedian's voice as only prompt.
After a sad movie many people will cry because they can be made to feel the sadness of a loss.
These are not isolated incidents.

But if we think about it, it is a miracle that this happens at all.
We all have different experiences and backgrounds.
What is sad to some can be enlightening to others.
Even the experience of a color is mediated by different relations between concepts,
as I have explored in [The Amazing Mind](https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind#my-blue-and-your-blue):
my "blue" is not your "blue".

How can works of art jump this schasm between our brains and reach our inner emotions?
We might boldly advance some evolutionary explanation about how shared feelings can be good for our survival,
but this modern sciency babbling would only offer some superficial comfort.
I prefer to just marvel at the fact that this happens at all.
Even in our era of hyper-saturation we still carry open wounds that can be poisoned from the outside world.

# AI "Art"

Our definition makes it clear that AI-generated images are not really, and can never be, art:
they don't transmit feelings.
Even the most ardent proponents of an AI future cannot get over this basic fact:
machines don't have any emotions to transmit.

LLMs are at their core just probabilistic generators.

## Algorithmic Music

Being generated by a computer does not mean that it cannot stir emotions.

# Artistic Categoriesa

## Fine Arts

The traditional [fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) are:
painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, theatre and dance.
Of these, not all transmit feelings the same way.

Architecture creates living spaces.

## Modern Arts

Modern categories often include cinema, photography, comics and video games.

What about [applied arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts)?
According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects aesthetically pleasing,
which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does therefore qualify under our definition.

## Should Be Arts?

But there are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions and could be considered art.
Let's review a few of them.

Comedic monologues: a category that transmits humor.

Eroticism: transmits feelings of sexual desire.
There is little concern with erotic literature and cinema,
but pornography can be quite controversial.
It is quite explicit about transmitting feelings,
especifically sexual arousal,
but it is banned in many cultures and poorly considered in many others.

[Erotic Kama statues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Erotic_Kama_statues_of_Khajuraho_Hindu_Temple_de_Lakshmana_Khajur%C3%A2ho_India_2013.jpg)

Advertising: designed to create feelings, like cravings or desire.

# Advice to the Modern Artist

Focus on creating feelings.
Technique, style, story telling, are all means to an end.
Learn to feel things yourself.
Raw emotions are hard.

It doesn't matter that everything has been said 1000 times;
audiences will still feel horror when watching a modern performance of [_Oedipus Rex_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex),
premiered almost 2500 years ago.
Incidentally is the oldest crime mystery where the killer is revealed to be the protagonist.

A singer that transmits their emotions in a live performance does not need perfect pitch,
autotune or a hundred synthesizers.

## Result not Process

Focus on the result,
and work backwards from there.

There are no cheap emotions,
although there are shortcuts to get them which make them feel cheap.
