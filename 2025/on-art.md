Art in our time may look like a bleak endeavor:
in an era of oversupply and saturation, isn't everything said and done?
And now with artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs)
the machines seem to be copying everything well enough;
what place is left for the fledging artist?
There is hope, my human friends!
Read on.

# üìñ A Brief Definition

Let us start by establishing this working definition:

> Art is any activity that intentionally transmits emotions among humans.

I am not simply making things up.
The Cambridge dictionary defines [art](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/art) as, among other things:

> the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that express feelings.

It is easy to see that acting (as seen in theater and movies) falls under this definition:
practitioners display a range of emotions which, when properly done, will carry over to the audience.
Other forms of art may not rely on direct empathy and therefore they are less immediate,
but they have in common that they stir something inside us.

## Transmitted Emotions

Feelings transmitted by art do not need to be profound.
Works that depict still life or daily routines can be awesome,
and sometimes they may just be aesthetically pleasing,
which is certainly a feeling that we share when contemplating them.
These works do not need to be doing anything else.

Deep _chiaroscuro_ in this beautiful painting.")

This aspect of aesthetic pleasure deserves some comment.
While a sunset can be beautiful and generate strong emotions (such as peacefulness, serenity, beauty),
it is not in itself artistic:
there is no transmission of emotions as we are just reacting to Nature.
A depiction of the same sunset in a painting or a photography however becomes artistic,
as those emotions are now transmitted from the person that feels them in the first place to its audience.
Such second-hand feelings become embedded in those works.

There are also very complex sentiments that can be transmitted using art.
That feeling you get when you are broke and looking at expensive things,
the sensation of being watched over by a benevolent god-like entity that doesn't care about you,
the inexplicable anguish we get when we see something irreparable that isn't even our fault.
Complex story-telling is only one way of getting these sensations across.

## Intentionality

A quick note on intention:
to be art the artist has to want to transmit the emotion.
If someone is just sad and watching them makes other people feel sad,
or if an artist wants to transmit one thing but then conveys another,
then it falls out of scope.
For instance, a movie director might want to create a work of horror and science fiction,
but accidentally make the audience feel vicarious shame.

[Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plan_9_Alternative_poster.jpg).

Many human activities make us feel emotions.
For instance a well designed and written software program may fill us with joy.
But when its intent is mainly functional we will not consider it "a work of art".
It is possible to write code with the purpose of making it beautiful,
and in this case we may well consider it artistic.

## Arts and Techniques

The purpose of many works of art across history has been simply to be a vehicle so artists can show their craft.
In painting this often goes under the guise of depicting reality.
"Look what awesome drawings I can make", Raffaello seems to be saying to Albrecht Durer in this
stunning study of two male figures.

![Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: [Google Art Project via Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_-_Nude_Studies,_1515_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg).](pics/on-art-raphael-nude-studies.jpg "Studies of two nude male figures drawn in red chalk.")

The text in the drawing, presumably written by Durer, [actually says](https://e-arthistory5.blogspot.com/2017/10/raphael-and-durer.html) as translated by David Handforth:

> 1515: Raphael of Urbino, who is so highly regarded by the Pope, asserts that he has made this nude drawing and sent it to Albrecht Duerer at Nuernberg in order to demonstrate to him his skill.

Confusingly, the [latin word _ars_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars) means: "art, skill, craft, handicraft".
We see this meaning today in phrases as "the art of..." for some method or trade,
meant to teach how to do something which has no relation to the fine arts.

We will stick to our definition.
Great art is supposed to not just depict reality,
but convey strong emotions.
Then why are skills important?
Good technique often helps ease the transmission of feelings.
Acting might be the most basic profession where you can just express a sentiment and rely on empathy,
and even so it is not enough.
If nothing else, skill is needed to create works of beauty.

# The Miracle of Art

The mere fact that feelings can be transmitted among humans is a miracle.
According to what I know my mind is a squishy mass enclosed in a bone cage,
that gets all its inputs from a bunch of wet cables.
Can it be that all outside things are just an illusion,
and that I exist in isolation imagining everything else?
This fantasy has been [paradoxically shared since the times of Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism#History).
For instance Descartes hypothesized that there was a
[malicious demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon) feeding him all perceptions,
to which there was hardly any escape.
The modern version would be that we live in a [computer simulation](https://pinchito.es/2021/understanding-simulation).

Let's suppose that we somehow live in the world that we perceive.
What we observe is that many humans can easily made to react the same way to the same stimulus.
At a comedic monologue everyone laughs in unison at the same time,
with a comedian's voice as only prompt.
After a good sad movie many people will cry because they can be made to feel the sadness.
These are not isolated incidents.

But if we think about it, it is a miracle that this happens at all.
We all have different experiences and backgrounds.
What is sad to some can be enlightening to others.
Even the experience of a color is mediated by different relations between concepts:
as I have explored in [The Amazing Mind](https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind#my-blue-and-your-blue),
my "blue" is not your "blue" and they can never be equal since we don't have the exact same concepts in our brains.

How can works of art jump the chasm among brains and reach our inner emotions?
We might advance some evolutionary explanation about how shared feelings can be good for our survival,
but this na√Øve sciency babbling can offer at most some superficial comfort.
I prefer to just marvel at the fact that this happens at all.
Even in our era of hyper-saturation and deep cynicism we still carry open wounds that can sometimes be activated by raw emotions.
For our sake as humans, let us hope it continues to be so.

# Artificial "Art"

Today the field of AI is full of very sophisticated generative models that can create complex images and even videos in seconds.
But are they really artistic?
Our definition makes it clear that any works generated by AI are not really, and can never be, art:
they cannot transmit emotions as computers cannot be made to feel.
Even the most ardent proponents of an AI future cannot get over this basic fact.

LLMs and generative models are at their core just probabilistic generators.
The fact that our emotional machinery can be tricked by them is no wonder,
as they are built to statistically replicate our works of art.
But they are often repetitive, bland and lack depth.

An artist can filter the output of generative models and find those that are effective in conveying emotion.

![Rafael Molina. Source: [Rafael Molina]().](pics/on-art-ai-generated.jpg "A colorful image of a boat in a lake with a sunset in the back.")

The challenge of a modern artist can be seen as the creation of works that AI cannot replicate,
either because they are innovative or too far out.
I will stick to principle and say that the challenge continues to be,
as always has been,
to stir emotions inside people.
Innovation is not the point.

## Algorithmic Art

Being generated by a computer does not mean that it cannot transmit feelings.
Artists can use algorithms to find and replicate sequences that create beautiful music.

# Advice to the Modern Artist

At this point we are ready to extract some conclusions.
Focus on creating feelings.
Technique, style, story telling, are all means to an end.
Learn to feel things yourself.
Raw emotions are hard.

It doesn't matter that everything has been said 1000 times;
audiences can still feel the anguish when watching a modern performance of
[_Oedipus Rex_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex),
premiered almost 2500 years ago.
Spoilers ahead:
every generation has to rediscover the mystery thriller where the killer is finally revealed to be the protagonist,
like in [these ten movies](https://screenrant.com/great-movies-hero-killer-all-along/).
(Incidentally, _Oedipus Rex_ did it first.)

A singer that transmits their emotions in a live performance does not need perfect pitch,
autotune or a hundred synthesizers.
On the other hand audiences tend to get bored and require some degree of novelty too.

## Result not Process

Focus on the result,
and work backwards from there.

There are no cheap emotions,
although there are shortcuts to get them which make them feel cheap.
People like to think they have earned their right to their feelings.

## Art and Style

Each artist has their own personal way of creating their works.
It serves as a kind of signature.
Style is not necessarily important for the transmission of feelings, though.
Some artists even make a point of being able to switch their ways freely.
While a personal imprint can be nice, it can also get in the way.

Actors sometimes complain that they are typecast in a kind of role, for instance.
The same can happen to many other artists if they specialize too much.
Artistic coherence is nice, but evolution as an artist also requires modifying your style.

[El Bosco](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hieronymus_Bosch_-_Saint_John_the_Baptist_in_the_Desert_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)

To the point that style is unavoidable, just embrace it.
But it can be worth your time to venture out of your own personality.

## Caveats

I don't have any particular credentials to speak about art,
other than I like to experience and enjoy it.
Sometimes I even create art in my own _dilettante_ fashion, like drawings or music.
I also like thinking hard about things that I find interesting,
and don't think that we should be limited to give our opinion on matters outside our experience.

On the other hand it is usually interesting to listen to experts.
In any case, take my advice with a grain of salt.

# Artistic Categories

What particular area of expertise should the fledging artist choose?
There are more than you think.
Let's now delve into the tricky world of categorizing art.

## Fine Arts

The traditional [fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) are:
painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, theatre and dance.
Of these, not all transmit feelings the same way.

Architecture creates living spaces.

### Abstract Art

It is not clear how abstract art transmits whatever it is supposed to be transmitting.
Is it skill by the author, a complex technique or the novelty of a new pattern?
I must confess that I don't get it,
and so seem to do most people as it has never gained widespread acceptance.

It is true that music in its purest form (without words or voices) is often seen as abstract.
The [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism) wondered about the geometric nature of musical chords,
found out experimentally by plucking a string of different ratios.
Why are some chords sad, while others feel feisty?
But the fact is that music can transmit strong complex emotions.
Film soundtracks are usually instrumental,
and they help carry the story forward to the point that movies feel naked without them.
On a more personal note,
once I was feeling nostalgic at a jazz guitar duo concert, only to learn later that
[the piece was called "Nostalgia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huZitIqcdt8&t=1611s).
I'm sure you have had similar experiences.

While I would not consider instrumental music abstract,
contemporary compositions often feel like it.
And to be honest I don't get them either.
So how can composers and performers deliver raw feelings just using different notes and chords?
The answer is that since they are human themselves,
they can try different things and see how they make themselves feel.
Art through empathy is a powerful mechanism,
and one that is not available to artificial intelligence for obvious reasons.

## Modern Arts

Modern categories often include cinema, photography or comics.

What about [applied arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts) like design or decoration?
According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects aesthetically pleasing,
which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does therefore qualify under our definition.

There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions and could be considered art.
Let's review a few of them, starting with the most obvious and going deeper with fringe acts.

### Computer Games

The most consumed form of art nowadays, it is easy to create beauty, strike fear,
tell interesting and immersive stories.

### Advertising

Designed to stimulate feelings like cravings or desire.
I don't see the fact that these works are done for crass commercial interests as a demerit:
or should Michelangelo be ashamed of accepting money for doing propaganda for the strongest powers of his time,
i.e. kings and popes?

### Comedic Monologues

A category that transmits humor.

### Eroticism and Pornography

Transmits feelings of sexual desire.
There is little doubt that erotic literature and cinema can be artistic,
but pornography can be quite controversial.
It is quite explicit about transmitting feelings,
more specifically sexual arousal,
but it is banned in many cultures and poorly considered in many others.
The figure below is from India, one of the scarce cultures where pornography was acceptable in temples.
(It's labeled "erotic" but it doesn't fool anyone.)

A small female figure licks the leg of the man. All figures are nude and wear intricate hairstyles, and some jewelry around their arms.")

### News

Under the guise of reporting, these brave people will try to arouse our interest,
while sometimes scaring or delighting the audience.
Their serious countenance cannot distract us from the fact that they are often dealing with raw emotions.

### Influencing

These people know how to make you feel stuff.
Be it beauty over Instagram, amazement over YouTube, or rage over shitposting.

### Gastronomy

Feeding people is not the point.
A good meal can make you feel a range of experiences.

### Politics

The ancient term [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric) is described in the Wikipedia page as "the art of persuasion".
It is really useful to explain things to others so that they see them as advantageous.
The classic philosopher Socrates despised sophists since they learned to defend both sides of an argument.
But contemplating different points of view can open your mind and widen your horizons.

### Magic

Magic makes you feel wonder.

### The Dark Arts

Going by our definition alone,
we could think that there are malicious activities which should be considered artistic.
A synonym for a scammer is "con artist", or confidence trickster.
In a [scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam) you have to make the victim, or "mark", feel confidence.
Similarly in [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) and other forms of social engineering.

There are even worse activities like abuse or mobbing,
where the victim is made to feel miserable.
I don't think anyone sane would want to call them arts even though there is transmission of emotions.
We may feel tempted to exclude negative emotions from our definition so we can get rid of similar pursuits,
but then we run the risk of banning also tragedies or sad movies.
We may prefer to realize that there is a dark side to some human activities which is highly damaging to people,
and choose not to consider it art.

# ü§î Conclusion

Learn how to transmit feelings.
It is useful in many ways of life;
to artists it is essential.
