Art in the era of oversupply, saturation,
artificial intelligence (AI)
and large language models (LLMs) may look as a bleak endeavor:
isn't everything said and done?
Aren't the machines copying everything well enough so there is no place for the fledging artist?
There is hope, my human friends!

# üìñ A Brief Definition

We will start with this working definition:

> Art is any activity that transmits emotions among humans.

I am not simply making things up.
The Cambridge dictionary defines [art](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/art) as, among other things:

> the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that express feelings.

It is easy to see that acting (as seen in theater and movies) falls under this definition:
actors and actresses try to display emotions,
which if properly done will carry over to the audience.
Other forms of art may not rely on empathy and therefore not be so immediate,
but they have in common that they stir something inside us.

## Transmitted Feelings

Feelings do not need to be profound.
Works that depict still life or daily routines can be awesome,
and sometimes they may just be aesthetically pleasing,
which is certainly a feeling that we share when contemplating them.
These works do not need to be doing anything else.

This aspect of aesthetic pleasure deserves some comment.
While a sunset can be beautiful and generate strong emotions (such as peacefulness, serenity, beauty),
it is not in itself artistic:
there is no transmission of emotions as we are just reacting to Nature.
A depiction of the same sunset in a painting or a photography however becomes artistic,
as those emotions are now transmitted from the person that feels them in the first place to its audience.
Such second-hand feelings become embedded in those works.

There are also very complex sentiments that can be transmitted using art.
That feeling you get when you are broke and looking at expensive things,
the sensation of being watched over by a benevolent god-like entity,
the inimaginable anguish we get when do something irreparable that isn't even our fault.
Complex story-telling is only one way of getting these things across.

## Arts and Techniques

The purpose of many works of art across history has been simply to be a vehicle so artists can show their craft.
In painting this often goes under the guise of depicting reality.
"Look what awesome drawings I can make", Raffaello seems to be saying to Albrecht Durer in this
[stunning study of two male figures](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Raphael_-_Nude_Studies,_1515_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg).

![Raphael: Nude Studies, 1515. Source: Google Art Project via Wikimedia.](pics/on-art-raphael-nude-studies.jpg "Studies of two nude male figures drawn in red chalk.")

The text in the drawing, presumably written by Durer, [actually says](https://e-arthistory5.blogspot.com/2017/10/raphael-and-durer.html) as translated by David Handforth:

> 1515: Raphael of Urbino, who is so highly regarded by the Pope, asserts that he has made this nude drawing and sent it to Albrecht Duerer at Nuernberg in order to demonstrate to him his skill.

Confusingly, the [latin word _ars_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars) means: "art, skill, craft, handicraft".
We see this meaning today in phrases as "the art of..." for some method or trade,
meant to teach how to do something which has no relation to the fine arts.

We will stick to our definition.
Great art is supposed to not just depict reality,
but convey strong emotions.
Then why are skills important?
Good technique often helps ease the transmission of feelings.
Acting might be the most basic profession where you can just express a sentiment and rely on empathy,
and even so it is not enough.
If nothing else, skill is needed to create works of beauty.

## Art and Style

Each artist has their own personal way of creating their works.
It serves as a kind of signature.
Style is not necessarily important for the transmission of feelings, though.
Some artists even make a point of being able to switch their ways freely.
While a personal imprint can be nice, it can also get in the way.

Actors sometimes complain that they are typecast in a kind of role, for instance.
The same can happen to many other artists if they specialize too much.
Artistic coherence is nice, but evolution as an artist also requires modifying your style.

# The Miracle of Art

The mere fact that feelings can be transmitted among humans is a miracle.
According to what I know my mind is a squishy mass enclosed in a bone cage,
that gets all its inputs from a bunch of wet cables.
Can it be that all outside things are just an illusion,
and that I exist in isolation imagining everything else?
This fantasy has been [paradoxically shared since the times of Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism#History).
For instance Descartes hypothesized that there was a [malicious demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon) feeding him images,
to which his only escape was to imagine that God would not let such demons ruin His creation.

What we observe is that many humans can easily made to react the same way to the same stimulus.
At a comedic monologue everyone laughs in unison at the same time,
with a comedian's voice as only prompt.
After a sad movie many people will cry because they can be made to feel the sadness of a loss.
These are not isolated incidents.

But if we think about it, it is a miracle that this happens at all.
We all have different experiences and backgrounds.
What is sad to some can be enlightening to others.
Even the experience of a color is mediated by different relations between concepts:
as I have explored in [The Amazing Mind](https://pinchito.es/2016/the-amazing-mind#my-blue-and-your-blue),
my "blue" is not your "blue" and they can never be equal since we don't have the same relations in our brains.

How can works of art jump this schasm between our brains and reach our inner emotions?
We might advance some evolutionary explanation about how shared feelings can be good for our survival,
but this na√Øve sciency babbling would offer at most some superficial comfort.
I prefer to just marvel at the fact that this happens at all.
Even in our era of hyper-saturation and deep cynicism we still carry open wounds that can sometimes be activated by raw emotions.
For our sake as humans, let it continue to be so.

# AI "Art"

Our definition makes it clear that AI-generated images are not really, and can never be, art:
they don't transmit feelings.
Even the most ardent proponents of an AI future cannot get over this basic fact:
machines don't have any emotions to transmit.

LLMs are at their core just probabilistic generators.
The fact that our emotional machinery can be tricked by them is no wonder,
as they are built to statistically replicate our works of art.
But they are often repetitive, bland and lack depth.

The challenge of a modern artist can be seen as the creation of works that AI cannot replicate,
either because they are innovative or too far out.
I will stick to principle and say that the challenge continues to be,
as always has been,
to stir emotions inside people.

## Algorithmic Art

Being generated by a computer does not mean that it cannot transmit feelings.
Artists can use algorithms to find and replicate sequences that create beautiful music.
They can also filter the output of generative algorithms and find hidden gems.

# Artistic Categories

Let's now delve into the tricky world of categorizing art.

## Fine Arts

The traditional [fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) are:
painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, theatre and dance.
Of these, not all transmit feelings the same way.

Architecture creates living spaces.

### Abstract Art

## Modern Arts

Modern categories often include cinema, photography or comics.

What about [applied arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts)?
According to Wikipedia they make everyday objects aesthetically pleasing,
which is undoubtedly a kind of feeling and does therefore qualify under our definition.

## Should Be Arts?

There are many other human activities that raise our inner emotions and could be considered art.
Let's review a few of them.

Comedic monologues: a category that transmits humor.

Eroticism: transmits feelings of sexual desire.
There is little doubt that erotic literature and cinema can be artistic,
but pornography can be quite controversial.
It is quite explicit about transmitting feelings,
more specifically sexual arousal,
but it is banned in many cultures and poorly considered in many others.

[Erotic Kama statues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Erotic_Kama_statues_of_Khajuraho_Hindu_Temple_de_Lakshmana_Khajur%C3%A2ho_India_2013.jpg)

Advertising: designed to create feelings, like cravings or desire.

Computer games: the most consumed form of art nowadays, it is easy to create beauty, strike fear,
tell interesting and immersive stories.

Influencing: these people know how to make you feel stuff.
Be it beauty over Instagram, amazement over YouTube, or rage over shitposting.

# Advice to the Modern Artist

Focus on creating feelings.
Technique, style, story telling, are all means to an end.
Learn to feel things yourself.
Raw emotions are hard.

It doesn't matter that everything has been said 1000 times;
audiences will still feel horror when watching a modern performance of [_Oedipus Rex_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex),
premiered almost 2500 years ago.
Incidentally is the oldest crime mystery where the killer is revealed to be the protagonist.

A singer that transmits their emotions in a live performance does not need perfect pitch,
autotune or a hundred synthesizers.

## Result not Process

Focus on the result,
and work backwards from there.

There are no cheap emotions,
although there are shortcuts to get them which make them feel cheap.
