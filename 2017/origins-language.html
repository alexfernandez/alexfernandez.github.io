<p>The relative scarcity of modern speculation about prehistoric languages is surprising, given how much interest there is both in academia and among the general public about other aspects of prehistoric life. The most likely reason is lack of direct evidence, which in these often unimaginative times can be a showstopper. But there are many indirect approaches that can give interesting answers.</p>
<p>In this article we will explore how language originated and developed in prehistoric times, combining language reconstruction and information theory with generous amounts of conjecture to arrive at a consistent view of language evolution. From beyond the mysts of time we will try to build a few defensible positions, or at the very least lay a path to future discovery.</p>
<h2 id="language-evolution">Language Evolution</h2>
<p>It is not reasonable to expect that language appeared at some point in the past, perfectly formed with all the elements that it has today.</p>
<h3 id="back-in-time">Back In Time</h3>
<p>Furthermore, in historic times there have been significant improvements. As <a href="#ref05">Bakker <em>et al</em> (2002)</a> hint, subordinate sentences were an innovation to Herodotus roughly 2,500 years ago (2.5 kya), who wrote endless sentences and often forgot to finish them (technically called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacoluthon">anacoluthon</a>).</p>
<p>Going further back into the past, partial reconstructions such as the enlightening work done with Indoeuropean shows that many elements of language that we take for granted are relatively recent additions. For instance, Proto-Indo-European (PIE) developed gender gradually, as explained by <a href="#ref06">Luraghi (2011)</a>.</p>
<p>How far back can we go with reconstructions? <a href="#ref03">García Calvo (2003)</a> was able to reconstruct an even earlier prehistoric language, as we will see below. Some researchers have even posited a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Human_language">Proto-Human language</a>, with little success and even less credibility. Past a certain point reconstructions are no use: our interest is not in tracing common roots for all languages, but to investigate how broad language features evolved.</p>
<p>We need some other tools to delve into the darkness of time.</p>
<h3 id="information-density">Information Density</h3>
<p>A very basic criteria that describes a language era is how many different words can be uttered. The number of possible words in a given language correlates strongly with how much information can be conveyed. First we will compute the information carried by a single word. Using the classic Shannon formula, see e.g. <a href="#ref27">Lombardi (2016)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I = -Σ p<sub>i</sub> log<sub>2</sub>(p<sub>i</sub>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there are <em>N</em> words, all equally likely, the resulting information is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I = log<sub>2</sub>(N)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we can do better using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf's law</a>, as characterized in <a href="#ref15">Yang (2013)</a>: it is the empirical distribution followed by all known languages. The resulting information content in bits per word, generated by <a href="origins-script.js">this script</a>, is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Adding more possiblities to the vocabulary increases the information carried by each word. Another way to convey more information is to combine words together; <a href="#information-content">below</a> we will see a couple of attempts at quantification.</p>
<p>Modern languages can be seen as open-ended: the number of productions is unlimited, as explained in <a href="#ref16">Trask (2003)</a>. This however needs not be the case in the past.</p>
<p>We have to suppose that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini">hominin</a> languages started somewhere, by assigning meaning to a few sounds. As the number of possible utterances increased, some methods to combine them appeared, thus also increasing the amount of information conveyed. The process must have conferred a distinct advantage to speakers, and so it has continued until the present time.</p>
<h2 id="a-timeline-proposal">A Timeline Proposal</h2>
<p>With this preliminary analysis in mind we can create the following timeline, dividing language evolution into a number of stages.</p>
<h3 id="individual-sounds">Individual Sounds</h3>
<p>Our most remote ancestors probably communicated using simple sounds. Many animals use distinct vocal utterances to express different meanings. Elements include: pitch, volume and articulation (the shape of the mouth to generate the sound).</p>
<p>At this point we cannot yet speak about words, since there is no language system. Each sound is uttered individually making its own &quot;sentence&quot;. Where there are no words there can be no proper sentences. And without words or sentences there is no &quot;language&quot; to speak about.</p>
<p>Do animals have a grammar, i.e. do they combine different signs into a coherent whole? More specifically, <a href="http://www.alphadictionary.com/articles/ling002.html">can chimpanzees talk</a>? <a href="#ref15">Yang (2013)</a> compares the relative frequency of words uttered by a chimpanzee with those from human language, and concludes that chimpanzees do not have a grammar.</p>
<p>We can suppose that early hominins had a way to augment their communication beyond what other primates can do, even without a grammar: perhaps by emitting a bigger range of sounds, or by adding context information with their hands. As <a href="#ref18">Tomasello (2008)</a> refers, pointing is a very human activity. This humble activity requires having a model of someone else's mind, and is therefore the basis for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deixis">deixis</a>.</p>
<p>This era is therefore the &quot;ground zero&quot; of language: the common base with animals, with deictic information added on top.</p>
<h3 id="single-consonants">Single Consonants</h3>
<p>The first stage of language may have involved single consonants. At this point the sounds from the previous step can be combined into sentences, making them basic building elements in very simplistic sentences. These simple elements to combine might be thought to have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_word">content words</a>: nouns, adjectives or verbs, as proposed by <a href="#ref08">Hurford (2003)</a>. Instead we will work from the opposite assumption, that these simple elements were only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word">function words</a>: prepositions, negations, pronouns, quantifiers and adverbs. Why? Simply because of sheer numbers.</p>
<p>The problem of single consonants is that there are not many of them. The number of simple, distinct sounds that can be uttered separately, without combining with others and without significant mixing, is limited. Modern languages can have as much as 87 consonants for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taa_language">Taa</a>, about 80 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubykh_language">Ubykh</a>. A single consonant word is thus limited to less than 100 words in the best of cases, and probably no further than 30 or so, since many of these consonants can be viewed as combinations of simpler sounds. These combinations may have evolved from consonant groupings, and be therefore modern constructions.</p>
<p>The number of consonants has likely increased with time. We can choose any number from 10 to 20 or so, with the reasonable assurance that at some point in time humans could only profer that number of words. A value of 12 seems certainly achievable, so it will serve as archetypical. We will use the symbol 𝛫 (math Kappa) to represent any single consonant.</p>
<p>Using content words would have limited utterances greatly, and specially the ability to combine them. Function words on the other hand can be combined readily, creating the first sentences. There are other reasons such as the use of pronouns ('I' and 'you') as deictic words in a sentence, without which conversations would be really inane and would be limited to point out that there are an entity from one of 12 possible categories out there, at any given time. Also, function words are always in a finite supply anyway, so they seem like a more natural fit for a very restricted set of words.</p>
<p>It is easy to defend a definite advantage for hominins that can combine simple meanings into one coherent whole, as compared with those that could only emit separate sounds. Group coordination becomes possible without having to see each other. Still, it is hard to see how a language of this kind could work. For illustration purposes, in the appendix we have an example of a <a href="#singlecon">single-consonant language</a>.</p>
<p>At which point in time did the era of single consonants start? The determination of the era of single consonants will have to involve considerable guesswork, being so far back in time. The advantage of group coordination would definitely have been greater when hominins started to hunt in groups, which may have been <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/homo-erectus-footprints-hint-at-ancient-hunting-party-1.17346">around two million years ago</a>. (2 Mya). According to <a href="#ref28">Roach (2016)</a>, around this point <em>Homo erectus</em> started to hunt and scavenge animals, increasing its meat consumption. But even such a simple language would also have been useful in foraging. An educated guess might thus be that around 1 Mya hominins could profer single consonants and combine them into simple sentences. We can thus identify the rise of <em>Homo Erectus</em> with the appearance of proper language.</p>
<h3 id="double-consonant-syllables">Double Consonant Syllables</h3>
<p>At some point early humans learned to combine several sounds into one syllable. This great advance extends the range of possible words at least by an order of magnitude. Considering the simplest structure of two consonants, or 𝛫𝛫, the number of words would be the square of the number of consonants. Adding a second consonant without a vowel may seem a strange choice. It is however a logical extension of the single-consonant words seen above, which does not require additional phonetic entities.</p>
<p>How do languages without vowels work? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English">rhotic</a> pronunciation of English omits vowels in many words. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxalk_language">Nuxalk or Bella Coola</a> is an example of a contemporary language without vowels; you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFnrp-cUTLQ">hear a sample</a>. From our modern perspective, not having vowels does not mean that all consonants are stuck together in an unpronunceable blob. It just means that vowels are not part of the language. Some kind of vocalic sound must still link the two consonants together, and mark syllable boundaries. This allows listeners to distinguish a double-consonant word 𝛫𝛫 from two single-consonant words 𝛫-𝛫.</p>
<p>We will use the symbol ∅ (empty set) to represent a vocalic separator. Biconsonant syllables will therefore be rendered as 𝛫∅𝛫. The evolution so far can be represented as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>𝛫 → 𝛫∅𝛫</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, ∅ can be a neutral vowel or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa">schwa</a>. It can also be a more definite vowel sound, either automatically assigned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)">prosodic rules</a>. or chosen at random. This would mean that e.g. the variants 'SAN', 'SIN' or 'SUN' are in fact different renditions of the same word 'S∅N'. Technically it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis">epenthetic vowel</a>, only present to link both consonants.</p>
<p>A two-consonant language might still preserve the original one-consonant functions words 𝛫, and add content words combining two consonants: 𝛫∅𝛫. A word during this era can therefore be either 𝛫 or 𝛫∅𝛫. 12 consonants would thus yield 144 + 12 = 156 combinations.</p>
<p>What brought forward this improvement? Calling syllables an <em>invention</em> may very well misleading: it is very likely that both proferring and parsing syllables require adaptations in the brains of speakers and listeners to handle the increased complexity. Probably the first words with two consonants were formed by common linguistic mechanisms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)">compounding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication">reduplication</a> of function words. The appendix has a <a href="#doublecon">hypothetical double-consonant language</a>.</p>
<p>Our reasonable guess for the double consonant era is that it overlapped largely with the emergence of <em>Homo Sapiens</em>, at around 200–100 kya. At this point modern hominins were evolving fast, with large brains and impressive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Paleolithic#Technology">advances in technology</a>. An exponential increase in the complexity of their communications would have suited perfectly their new activities, and would be a great help for the the new challenges they were facing.</p>
<p>A note on the European branch of the family is in order. Neanderthals are usually classified as a distinct species from <em>Homo Sapiens</em>. Given the now ample evidence that both groups could and did interbred, as reviewed in <a href="#ref23">Groucutt <em>et al</em> (2015)</a>, it does not seem unreasonable to classify them as two different subspecies inside <em>Homo Sapiens</em>, as many scientists have advocated for decades. The degree of shared evolution is far from clear, but there may have been only minute differences between African and Neanderthal language evolution.</p>
<h3 id="vowels">Vowels</h3>
<p>At some point in time vowels become first-class citizens. With vowels the number of possible syllables grows a bit. A proper vowel is represented by the symbol 𝛢 (math Alpha). Let us suppose that there are three possible vowels at some point in time, along with the original 12 consonants. The number of combinations is now: consonant + vowel + consonant, or 𝛫𝛢𝛫, with 432 combinations; adding the original 12 single-consonant function words 𝛫 yields a total of 444 combinations. Note that function words may also acquire vowels to yield simple structures like 𝛫𝛢, in order to increase their number to 36; in this case yielding 468 possible words.</p>
<p>The process of vowel acquisition may require larynx, ear and brain adaptations to generate, distinguish and process the new grammatical elements. The incorporation of vowels into consonantic languages may happen similarly to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut">Indo-European ablaut</a> or more generally as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophony">vowel apophony</a>: vowels enter the system as modifiers for existing roots.</p>
<p>Tracing the appearance of vowels in all languages is again a hard issue. At what point did this happen? Vowels may in fact have appeared several times throughout prehistory. Almost all known languages have at least a few vowels, so that we can infer that their appearance happened before the last diaspora at around 70–50 kya. We will suppose that it did not happen much earlier than that.</p>
<h3 id="monosyllabic-explosion">Monosyllabic Explosion</h3>
<p>In this next period the number of words grows in a number of ways while they remain monosyllables. The basic problem of a monosyllabic language is how to cram a large number of words into a single syllable. There are many possible solutions, all of which can be seen in modern use. They fall broadly into three categories.</p>
<p>The first strategy is to increase the number of consonants and vowels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add clicks, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoisan_languages">Khoisan click languages</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6WO5XabD-s">sample</a>).</li>
<li>Consonant combinations, such as the mix of ⟨t⟩ and ⟨ʃ⟩ to form the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_palato-alveolar_affricate">modern sound for 'ch'</a>, tellingly shown in IPA as ⟨tʃ⟩.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second strategy is to add more phonemes per syllable.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_cluster">Consonant clusters</a>: sequences of consonants without vowels.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong">Diphthongs</a> allow combinations of vowels in a single syllable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last strategy is to add modifiers for vowels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add different tones, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)">tonal languages</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages">Bantu</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXAnrqkt_yM">sample</a>)</li>
<li>Add different contours, as in Chinese (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkMbSWwS3FA">sample</a>). They are a special kind of tone that may vary within a syllable.</li>
<li>Add nasalized vowels as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Qs75dfpko">sample</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that all of these mechanisms are so different is a testimony that they were probably developed separately. This is only possible if they happened after <em>Homo Sapiens</em> left Africa, around 70–50 kya. After that point each region may have developed their own extensions to monosyllables. It is interesting to note that tonal languages have developed mostly <a href="http://wals.info/feature/13A#2/19.3/152.9">in Africa and Southern Asia</a>, while more complex syllable structures are more abundant <a href="http://wals.info/feature/12A#2/19.3/152.9">in Europe and North America</a>.</p>
<p>It is not unreasonable to suppose that all languages were monosyllabic at least until 50 kya, probably later. The new techniques to increase vocabulary sizes were surely there for the transition to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> as described by <a href="#ref19">Bar-Yosef (2002)</a>, which must have required a broader lexicon of plants, animals, materials, tools and techniques.</p>
<p>Starting with our basic structure of 12 consonants and 3 vowels, a conservative estimation for syllable variability might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing to 20 consonants and 9 vowels for structure 𝛫𝛢𝛫 yields 3600 combinations.</li>
<li>New syllable structures 𝛫𝛫𝛢𝛫 or 𝛫𝛢𝛫𝛫 yield 5184 combinations each.</li>
<li>Adding four tones per vowel for structure 𝛫𝛢𝛫 yield 1728 combinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course many of these innovations may have been used in conjunction to achieve even greater vocabularies. This increase of combinations may have enabled the separation of word forms for verbs, nouns and adjectives, effectively establishing word classes as we know them.</p>
<h3 id="polysyllables">Polysyllables</h3>
<p>An immediate extension of two consonant words are three consonant words. Continuing with the basic structure of 12 consonants and three vowels, there are now the following combinations: 12 𝛫, 444 𝛫𝛢𝛫, and 15552 𝛫𝛢𝛫𝛢𝛫, for a total of 16008 combinations. A gain of more than an order of magnitude over monosyllabic words.</p>
<p>However, and a bit surprisingly, it does not look as if this extension has happened early in prehistoric times. At what point did polysyllabic words arise? Arab and other semitic languages have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_root">triliteral roots</a> consisting of three consonants. It looks like a straightforward extension of the two-consonant syllables seen above. <a href="#ref17">Agmon (2010)</a> shows that for Semitic languages, the transition from two- to three-consonant roots happened during the transition to the Neolithic period, or 15–10 kya.</p>
<p><a href="#ref03">García Calvo (2003)</a> reconstructed a prehistoric language ancestral to Indo-European and Proto-Indo-European with just two consonants per syllable and without vowels. In constrast, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language">Proto-Indo-European (PIE)</a> already has polysyllabic words and vowels; it is in fact a mostly modern language with suffixes, pronouns and conjugation. PIE was supposedly spoken <a href="http://www.archaeology.org/exclusives/articles/1302-proto-indo-european-schleichers-fable">around 7 kya</a>, which is very close to historic times in many places of the world. A timescale was not given by García Calvo, but we may again deduce that the transition from monosyllabic language to PIE may have happened near the transition to the Neolithic period.</p>
<p>The Sino-Tibetan family might seem a perfect example of the transition to polysyllabic languages in near-historical times, since many languages have monosyllabic morphemes. But <a href="#ref14">Michaud (2012)</a> refers that these monosyllables are often the result of compacting longer words, and therefore not a direct descendent of monosyllabic languages. In the reconstruction of <a href="#ref12">Baxter &amp; Sagart (2014)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Chinese">Old Chinese</a> was already polysyllabic. There are however some hints at monosyllabic Sino-Tibetan ancestors as in <a href="#ref13">Lama (2012)</a>, as recently as 4 kya.</p>
<p>Languages probably adopted polysyllabic forms as the necessity arose, given their particular information density configurations. In combination with other monosyllabic techniques they may have easily achieved vocabularies of tens of thousands of words. These newfound combinatorial riches allow for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation">conjugations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension">declensions</a> and other modern language features. This leaves us just right before the invention of writing, which is the point where Prehistory ends along with our journey.</p>
<h3 id="time-scales">Time Scales</h3>
<p>Figure 1 shows several time scales for language eras as discussed.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/origins-time-scales.svg" title="Different time scales for language eras" alt="Figure 1: Language time scales. Prepared by the author." />
<p class="caption"><a href="pics/origins-time-scales.svg">Figure 1: Language time scales</a>. Prepared by the author.</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 1-a shows how the period under study looks when represented linearly. Hardly anything can be shown since most of the period is occupied by the single consonant era.</p>
<p>Figure 1-b shows the main eras along with the hominin species that was thriving at the moment. The single consonant era has been compressed for easier visualization. Note that Neanderthals are included in <em>Homo Sapiens</em>.</p>
<p>Figure 1-c shows an alternate time scale with logarithmic axis. The scale has been expanded to include the apparition of the first hominins, about 5 Mya. The graph ends at the beginning of history around 5 kya. Note that it would not be particularly hard (and it may be tempting) to make all eras approximately equal in the logarithmic axis, which would give a nice picture of constantly accelerating linguistic progress. But the change would break all the known boundaries of cultures and species.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-timelines">Alternative Timelines</h2>
<p>There are a number of possible objections that can be raised about this timeline.</p>
<h3 id="recent-origin">Recent Origin</h3>
<p>Many scholars support a much later date for the appearance of language, around 100 kya, as reported by <a href="#ref07">Dediu <em>et al</em> (2013)</a>. This is not supported by evidence.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone">hyoid bone</a> is a critical part of our capacity to speak; more specifically it is used for articulation. <a href="#ref25">Martínez <em>et al</em> (2008)</a> report that a couple of hyoid bones of hominins from 530 kya are very similar to samples from modern humans. <a href="#ref24">D'Anastasio <em>et al</em> (2013)</a> find the hyoid bone in Neanderthals to be structurally very similar to modern samples. Even further, <a href="#ref26">Martínez <em>et al</em> (2013)</a> find that 530 kya hominins had a similar auditory range to modern humans.</p>
<p>Barring some theory that explains why non-speaking hominins had similar bones as we use today for speech, these findings are probably enough to discard this timeline. Furthermore, a sample from 3.3 Mya ago is very similar to the hyoid bone of modern chimpanzees, which seems to imply that speech capabilities were developed between 3.3 Mya and 530 kya.</p>
<h3 id="earlier-monosyllabic-explosion">Earlier Monosyllabic Explosion</h3>
<p>Our estimation for the monosyllabic explosion is from 50 to 15 kya, due to the divergence of schemes to augment monosyllables found across the world. There is a small problem with this argument. When <em>Homo Sapiens</em> left Africa, there was already a sizeable population of Neanderthals occupying Europe and Asia. So it is reasonable to think that these same Neanderthals might have their own languages, which influenced any newcomers. In this case the monosyllabic explosion might have happened much earlier.</p>
<p>It may be an interesting avenue of enquiry. Its first obstacle is to reconcile the earlier monosyllabic explosion with the late appearance of polysyllables that we have seen in many language families. What happened in between? Unless a satisfactory answer for the extended era is found, this point of view should be put on hold.</p>
<h3 id="earlier-introduction-of-vowels">Earlier Introduction Of Vowels</h3>
<p>The choice of early words consisting of two consonants may seem arbitrary. It is very well possible that vowels were introduced earlier, perhaps with the first syllables. Words might consist of one consonant plus one vowel; just adding three vowels to a 12-consonant language would extend the number of words from 12 to 36.</p>
<p>But there is some evidence supporting the late appearance of vowels. <a href="#ref03">García Calvo (2003)</a> made the argument that prehistoric Indo-European in its earliest incarnation had no vowels: just function words with a single consonant, and content words consisting of two juxtaposed consonants. As we saw before there is no timescale for this language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are languages with very different syllable structures, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Arrernte_language">Upper Arrernte</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiBnZjOahhM">sample</a>). Interestingly enough, almost all languages with <a href="http://wals.info/chapter/12">simple syllable structures</a>. (V or CV) are <a href="http://wals.info/feature/12A#2/19.3/152.9">almost exclusively found</a> in Africa, South America or Pacific Islands, suggesting some ancestral clustering.</p>
<p>Ultimately this question is hard to answer and not terribly significant. It is possible that certain proto-languages have developed vocals first, and they may have added a second consonant to syllables later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>𝛫 → 𝛫𝛢 → 𝛫𝛢𝛫.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare this path with the one described above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>𝛫 → 𝛫∅𝛫 → 𝛫𝛢𝛫.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More complex paths are possible: developing vocals first, losing them later in favor of biconsonant words, and regaining them later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>𝛫 → 𝛫𝛢 → 𝛫∅𝛫 → 𝛫𝛢𝛫.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, the number of words grows monotonically.</p>
<h2 id="language-as-a-tool">Language As A Tool</h2>
<p>Language has many uses. There can be no doubt that it has gained utility with time.</p>
<h3 id="information-content">Information Content</h3>
<p>A very basic criteria that describes a language era is how many different words can be uttered. The information content of a sentence depends largely on the number of different meanings that can be conveyed, and therefore on the number of words per sentence.</p>
<p>We can estimate the average number of words per sentence using MLU, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_length_of_utterance">Mean Length of Utterance</a>. <a href="#ref01">Kemper &amp; Sumner (2001)</a> estimate that young adults have a MLU of around 12 ± 4. With a vocabulary of around <a href="http://www.lextutor.ca/research/nation_waring_97.html">20k words</a> following a Zipf distribution, each word would carry around 10 bits of information, as we saw <a href="#information-density">above</a>. Therefore a typical adult sentence might carry 120 bits of information, if all words were independent.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="pics/origins-mlu.jpg" title="MLU correlated with vocabulary size" alt="Figure 2: Mean Lenght Of Utterance In Children. From Devescovi et al (2005)." />
<p class="caption"><a href="pics/origins-mlu.jpg">Figure 2: Mean Lenght Of Utterance In Children</a>. From Devescovi <em>et al</em> (2005).</p>
</div>
<p>What happens with smaller vocabularies? <a href="#ref02">Devescovi <em>et al</em> (2005)</a> estimate that children with a vocabulary of 101-200 words have a MLU of around 3.5 words. 200 words following a Zipf distribution would carry around 6 bits per word, yielding a total of 21 bits per sentence. Similarly, 400 words would have a MLU of around 4 words, which at 6.5 bits per word would yield 26 bits per sentence. 1000 words are outside their range of study, but a MLU of 10 words seems a reasonable extrapolation; at 7.5 bits per word each sentence would reach 75 bits. 100 words correspond to a MLU of 3 and 5.3 bits per word, or 16 bits per sentence. On the lower range, a vocabulary of 12 words might have a MLU of 2, which combined with 3 bits per word yields 6 bits per sentence.</p>
<p>Data from both studies is not necessarily compatible, as they use different definitions for MLU. Yet it is reasonable to expect that after a point, increasing the vocabulary does not entail a corresponding increase in sentence size. The following table summarizes these estimations.</p>
<table>

<p>This gross approximation is enough to show that that increasing vocabulary size initially yields large advances in communication, and then tapers off. After around 1000 words gains are incrementally smaller. In fact, information content would grow even more slowly with vocabulary size when considering redundancy in sentences. In general words in a sentence are not independent: 'house' is much more likely to follow 'the' than 'far'. Particles and other function words are highly redundant. The actual number of bits per sentence is thus much lower than represented. The values above can only be considered bounding limits.</p>
<p>We will now delve into how different uses for language are enabled by increasing information content.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The most primitive use of language is related to the present situation. It is used to <em>remove ambiguity</em>. Say that two hominins <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are in a certain setting. <em>A</em> sees an animal, and wants to communicate it to <em>B</em>. Perhaps their common language has an utterance for 'warning', not necessarily a word: it may be a simpler sound like a shout, probably combined with a prosodic mark such as an intonation. It will be <em>A</em>'s first utterance. Combined with a pointing hand it may be enough to make <em>B</em> look and appraise the situation on their own. But then <em>A</em> may want to give <em>B</em> a more precise idea of the situation, even if <em>B</em> is not currently able to see the animal: let us suppose it just fled, or maybe <em>B</em> is far away. At some other situation there may be a group of listeners: a shout that lets them know there is a bear nearby will be much more effective than waiting for them to look for it. Their reaction if there is a rabbit instead should be equally swift but completely different.</p>
<p>If their language only has a single word for all animals <em>A</em> will utter 'animal', which is not very precise: there is a lot of ambiguity. It could be a wolf or a sheep, and both situations will probably call for very different actions. Perhaps there will be words for 'big' and 'small', so some of the ambiguity can be removed by saying 'animal small' or 'animal big'. But a small wolf and a big sheep still call for different actions. A language with different words for 'wolf' and 'sheep' will have a distinct advantage for its speakers. Given the number of different animal species, a large vocabulary is required to accurately represent even the most common animal families (i.e. a single word for 'wolf', 'dog' and 'fox'). Increasing the number of possible words is thus crucial to remove all ambiguity.</p>
<p>More information can be added by adding a plural form: 'one wolf' is a very different situation from 'wolves' for our hypothetical hominins. Again, this requires increasing the number of possible words.</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>Another important use is training. Here too language can help to <em>remove ambiguity</em>. Complex techniques require very precise movements, be they used for tool making, gathering food or hunting game. Language can be a powerful teaching aid.</p>
<p>Composite materials used for hafting stones to handles require precise combinations of materials, each in turn gathered from the correct environment. <a href="#ref04">Wadley <em>et al</em> (2009)</a> explain how red ochre and tree gum must be mixed in precise proportions and heated near a fire at between 250 °C and 300 °C to obtain a composite glue for hafting stone points to wooden handles. There is only one species <em>Acacia karroo</em> which is ideally suited for the process, and the proportion of ochre must be adjusted depending on its iron content. This complex process carries a lot of ambiguity that has to be removed in the teaching process; it is easy to imagine how training time would have been reduced substantially with verbal aids guiding the process. Given that there are archeological samples of such composite materials from at least 70 kya it seems that language must have been quite advanced by then.</p>
<h3 id="telling-stories">Telling Stories</h3>
<p>A more elaborate use of language is storytelling. In this setting the speakers are recounting previous events. Here too <em>removing ambiguity</em> is essential.</p>
<p>Storytelling is useful as training: someone listening to hunting stories may learn tips and tricks. But it goes much deeper than that. Stories carry with them mythology, world view, family tree, ethics; in short, the essentials of human culture. A complex language and vocabulary allow for better transmission of information among groups and between generations. Groups with strong oral culture have an advantage over those without, especially in a crisis as described by <a href="#ref21">Minc (1985)</a>.</p>
<p>The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition">oral traditions</a> have existed for so long, and even now are still maintained by certain groups, points to some innate capability in humans. Our fascination with hearing stories is present today thinly disguised as books or movies. We still get most of our morals in the form of exemplifying stories.</p>
<p>Stories are possible with a limited set of words: Dr Seuss' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat">The Cat in the Hat</a> contains only 236 different words, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham">Green Eggs and Ham</a> is limited to 50. But these were stories tailored to suit the limited number of words. Experiments like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English">Basic English</a> with a limited vocabulary (850 words) and simplified grammar rules have had some success among foreign speakers. It would be enlightening to learn if a complex story can be told with an even more limited vocabulary.</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-evidence">Sources Of Evidence</h2>
<p>Language does not fossilize. This well-known fact means that all of our knowledge about how language evolved before the invention of writing is pure speculation. Or is it? As a matter of fact, there are several sources of evidence about prehistoric languages.</p>
<h3 id="physical-remains">Physical Remains</h3>
<p>Archeological remains are the first and foremost source of evidence about all things prehistoric. We know the lifestyle and capabilities of our ancestors thanks to the remains that they left behind.</p>
<p>We have seen <a href="#recent-origin">above</a> how hyoid bones seem to imply that hominins could already articulate 530 kya (and no sooner than 3.3 Mya). More samples might help us pinpoint these dates more exactly.</p>
<p>There is also symbolic evidence which might prove even more valuable. <a href="#ref20">Von Petzinger (2009)</a> has found that the same set of symbols is repeated in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings across much of France, and then <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230990-700-in-search-of-the-very-first-coded-symbols/">around the world</a>. There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_and_ring_mark">cup and ring marks</a> from later periods, and probably many more overlooked prehistoric marks.</p>
<p>Do they represent concepts of some kind, or are they just pretty designs? Are marks more likely to represent functions words, or are they content words? With a more concrete language description in mind it is conceivable that these inscriptions might be decyphered, or at least put in context.</p>
<h3 id="modern-languages">Modern Languages</h3>
<p>Today there are about <a href="https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/how-many-languages">7,099 languages</a>. spoken around the world. It is to be expected that any features before these languages separated would be shared.</p>
<p>Watching the distribution of certain features can be very instructive. <a href="http://wals.info/">The World Atlas of Language Structures Online (WALS)</a> is a great resource organized by language features. It is entirely possible that the distribution of some features is the direct result of prehistoric migrations.</p>
<h3 id="language-reconstructions">Language Reconstructions</h3>
<p>Indoeuropean is the most widely known and studied archaic language, but many others have been reconstructed. A few protolanguages (like Proto-Indo-European or PIE) have also been postulated with varied success.</p>
<p>Rate of linguistic change is hard to estimate. <a href="#ref22">Nettle (1999)</a> argues that languages change faster in small populations. It remains to be seen how ancient languages can be reconstructed to such a high degree of precision if they were spoken by relatively few people for many centuries.</p>
<p>Reconstructions rarely go back beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution">Neolithic revolution</a>, around 12 kya. Except glorious exceptions like the study by <a href="#ref03">García Calvo (2003)</a>, they are of limited value to infer how or when language features evolved. It remains to be seen if the veils of time can be pierced any further.</p>
<h3 id="genetics">Genetics</h3>
<p>There are many genes responsible for speech. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2">FOXP2</a> is the most famous and studied of all. This gene has the same expression in humans and Neanderthals, from which <a href="#ref07">Dediu <em>et al</em> (2013)</a> deduce that both groups had mostly equivalent language capabilities. It is likely that we will be able to trace evolution of speech even further back in time by following how this and other genes have evolved.</p>
<p>Another important area of study is speech disorders. The best way to learn how a machine works is often watching how it malfunctions. Similarly, it is now possible to study how defects in individual genes affect individuals that carry them. So e.g. if a gene that enables polysyllabic speech can be identified, it should be possible to study how people without it (or with a non-functional variant) can communicate. For instance, <a href="#ref10">Vargha-Khadem <em>et al</em> (1995)</a> study the implications of a genetic problem in FOXP2 on a large family. Would it be possible to find variants of this and other genes that limit for instance polysyllabic communication?</p>
<p>Genetics may thus serve as empirical test of the timeline that has been sketched in this article.</p>
<h3 id="previous-studies">Previous Studies</h3>
<p>While not direct evidence, there is a growing amount of literature about the origins of language. <a href="#ref09">Smillie (1985)</a> models the evolution of early languages on the acquisition of language by children. <a href="#ref08">Hurford (2003)</a> offers a limited view of proto-languages, where at the beginning they would have no function words. In the same volume, <a href="#ref11">Newmeyer (2003)</a> gives an overview of other theories.</p>
<p>It is my sincere hope that I have overlooked a mountain of literature specifying how languages came to be the complex wonders that we know, feature by feature and with even more fantastical timelines. If it does not exist, it definitely should.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unraveling the origins of language is a particularly hard task, which was once famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language">banned by the Linguistic Society of Paris</a>. In this article we have seen a possible evolution path that takes us from animal sounds to the written word. We have also explored briefly how it fits with known evidence and how to refine or refute it with more research.</p>
<p>The whole endeavour may seem idle speculation. After all it may seem impossible to refute most of what has been said here. But it is my belief that there is fruitful research to be done. A theory only needs to be consistent with the known facts, and it is partially validated when it can explain new phenomena.</p>
<p>Learned discussion about very early phonetics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics">phonotactics</a> and grammar may take us a long way towards a deeper understanding of our ancestors.</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>It becomes much easier to visualize language types with an example. In the appendix we will explore several hypothetical languages to illustrate the different eras of language evolution.</p>
<h3 id="singlecon">Singlecon</h3>
<p>The first language has just words that consist of a single consonant. We will call this hypothetical primitive language 'Singlecon'.</p>
<h4 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h4>
<p>In Singlecon we only have 12 words, that correspond to the 12 consonants:</p>
<ul>
<li>one preposition: 'to' ('R'),</li>
<li>one negation: 'no' ('P'),</li>
<li>two non-numeral quantifiers: 'much' ('K') and 'little' ('D'),</li>
<li>two numerals that double as pronouns: 'one' or 'me' ('V') and 'two' or 'you' ('N'),</li>
<li>and six adverbs: 'down' ('L'), 'up' ('S'), 'here' ('M'), 'near' ('T'), 'out' ('H') and 'far' ('F').</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the language consists only of function words. There are no content words: nouns, verbs or adjectives.</p>
<h4 id="samples">Samples</h4>
<p>A few sentences in Singlecon follow. They show the value of combining words for a group of foragers or hunters.</p>
<ul>
<li>'T L.' means 'near down.': the objective is near but they need to go down.</li>
<li>'K K'. means 'much much.': there is a lot of what the speaker is interested in.</li>
<li>'V M. N H.' means 'one here. two out.': the speaker will remain here while the listener goes away.</li>
<li>'V R. N M.' means 'one to. two here.': the speaker will go to the objective; the listener must stay here.</li>
<li>'K S. D M.' means 'much up. little here.': there is a large quantity of what the speaker is seeking going up, while there is little to be found here.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="grammar">Grammar</h4>
<p>Even with such a simple language a grammar would be needed, to convey different meanings depending on the combination. For instance, 'near much' would mean that the objective is very near, while 'much near' would mean that there is a lot of what the speaker is seeking nearby.</p>
<h2 id="doublecon">Doublecon</h2>
<p>Our next language is an evolution of Singlecon that allows for monosyllabic words with two consonants and a schwa, expressed as 𝛫∅𝛫. It keeps the same set of single-consonant function words, while the new combinations are all content words. We will call it Doublecon.</p>
<h3 id="vocabulary-1">Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Doublecon has a maximum of 144 content words, that can work as nouns, verbs or adjectives depending on the situation. Content words are formed with two consonants by reduplication and composition of function words.</p>
<ul>
<li>The combination of 'down' ('L') and 'to' ('R') is 'L∅R' and refers to something that moves on the ground such as a small animal.</li>
<li>'up' ('S') + 'to' ('R') is 'S∅R': a big animal.</li>
<li>'near' ('T') + 'much' ('K'), 'T∅K': family.</li>
<li>'near' ('T') combined with itself is 'T∅T' which means 'good'.</li>
<li>'to' + 'down', 'R∅L': trail.</li>
<li>'to' + 'near', 'R∅T': run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all combinations are used by actual words; of the 144 possibilities for 𝛫∅𝛫 only about 100 are valid.</p>
<p>Even when words are formed as compounds there is considerable arbitrariness in the process. The combination of 'down' with 'to' ('L∅R') is small animal, while 'to' + 'down' ('R∅L') is trail. It might perfectly be the other way around, so it is purely a matter of convention.</p>
<h3 id="prosody">Prosody</h3>
<p>There are three possible sentence intonations, indicated here by the sentence ending sign:</p>
<ul>
<li>neutral, marked with a dot '.',</li>
<li>interrogative: marked with an interrogation mark '?',</li>
<li>and exclamative: marked with an exclamation mark '!'.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no other possible intonations such as our comma ','. Sentences may follow each other closely, with a pause between them.</p>
<h3 id="samples-1">Samples</h3>
<p>A few sentences in Doublecon follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>'T∅K M. T∅K T∅T.': 'family here. family good', the good family has arrived.</li>
<li>'V R S∅R. N M.': 'me to big animal. you here.', I will go to the big animals, you stay here.</li>
<li>'S∅R K S.': 'big animal much up', there is much big game going up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it is very important to distinguish between two single-consonant words and one syllable: 'S R' from 'S∅R'. In the first case there is a small pause between 'S' and 'R', similar to the intersyllabic transition in modern languages, as in English 'pos·ter'. In the case of 'S∅R' the schwa provides vocal continuity.</p>
<h3 id="grammar-1">Grammar</h3>
<p>Even at this level, a simplistic grammar is needed to combine content and function words.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)">copula</a> is straightforward juxtaposition: 'V T∅K' means 'I am family'.</p>
<p>Some words can be both nouns or verbs, such as 'R∅T': run, or 'R∅L': trail. Nouns are always the first word, followed by verbs or adjectives: 'S∅R R∅T' means 'big animal runs'. Another possibility is juxtaposition of two nouns: 'R∅L S∅R' means 'trail of a big animal'. Verbs can also appear on their own or with function words: 'R∅T K!' means 'run a lot!' (remember that 'K' means 'much'), and so with adjectives: 'T∅T K' means 'very good'.</p>
