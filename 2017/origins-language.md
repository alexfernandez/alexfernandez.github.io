The lack of modern speculation about prehistoric language is surprising,
given how much interest there is both academia and the general public
about other aspects of prehistoric life.
The lack of direct evidence in these unimaginative times
is the most probable reason.
But there is an indirect approach that combines
language reconstruction and information theory
to arrive at a consistent evolution.

In this article we will explore how language originated and developed
in prehistoric times.
From beyond the mysts of time we will try to make reasoned conjectures.

## The Eras Of Language

It is not reasonable to expect that language appeared at some point in the past,
perfectly formed with all the elements that it has today.
Even partial language reconstructions such as the enlightening work done with Indoeuropean
shows that many elements are recent additions.

### Historical Evolution

Furthermore, in historic times there have been significant improvements.
Subordinate sentences were pretty new to Herodotus,
who wrote endless sentences and often forgot to finish them
(technically: [anacoluthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacoluthon)).

### Number Of Words And Information Content

A very basic criteria that describes a language era is
how many different words can be uttered.
The informational content of a sentence depends largely
on the number of different meanings that can be conveyed,
and on the number of words per sentence.

We can estimate the average number of words per sentence using MLU,
Mean Length of Utterance.
Kemper & Sumner estimate that young adults have a MLU of around 12 ± 4.
With a vocabulary of around 10k words,
following a Zipf distribution,
each word would carry around 10 bits of information.
Therefore a typical adult sentence might carry 120 bits of information,
if all words were independent.

What happens with smaller vocabularies?
Devescovi _et al_ estimate that children with a vocabulary of 101-200 words
have a MLU of around 3 words.
200 words following a Zipf distribution would carry around 6 bits per word,
yielding a total of 18 bits per sentence.
Similarly, 400 words would have a MLU of around 4 words,
which at 6.5 bits per word would yield 26 bits per sentence.
1000 words are outside their range of study,
but a MLU of 10 words seems a reasonable extrapolation;
at 7.5 bits per word each sentence would reach 75 bits.
On the lower range, a vocabulary of 12 words might have a MLU of 2,
which combined with 3 bits per word yields 6 bits per sentence.
The following table summarizes these estimations.

|Vocabulary	size|MLU	|Bits per word	|Bits per sentence	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|12	|2	|3	|6	|
|200	|3	|6	|18	|
|400	|4	|6.5	|26	|
|1000	|10	|7.5	|75	|
|10k	|12	|10	|120	|

Of course words in a sentence are not independent:
'house' is much more likely to follow 'the' than 'far'.
The actual number of bits per sentence is thus much lower than represented.
But this gross approximation is enough to show that that increasing vocabulary size
yields large advances in communication,
up to a point.
After around 1000 words gains are incrementally smaller.

In fact, information content would grow even more slowly with vocabulary size,
when considering redundancy in sentences.
Particles and other function words are highly redundant.

## A Timeline Proposal

With this data in mind we can create the following timeline.

### Individual Sounds

Our most remote ancestors must have communicated using sounds.
Many animals use distinct vocal utterances to express different meanings.
Elements include: pitch, volume and articulation
(the shape of the mouth to generate the sound).

At this point we cannot yet speak about words,
since there is no language system.
Each sound is uttered individually,
making its own "sentence".
Of course,
where there are no words there can be no proper sentences.

### Single Consonants

The first organization of language must have involved single consonants.
At this point these consonants can be combined into sentences,
making them basic building elements in a very simplistic sentences.
To combine simple elements they must have been only function words:
prepositions, negations, pronouns, quantifiers and adverbs.
There can be no content words: nouns, adjectives or verbs.

The problem of single consonants is that there are not many of them.
The number of simple, distinct sounds that can be uttered separately,
without combining with others and without significant mixing,
is limited.
Modern languages can have as much as
87 consonants for [Taa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taa_language),
about 80 for
[Ubykh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubykh_language).
A single consonant word is thus limited to less than 100 words
in the best of cases,
and probably no further than 30 or so,
since many of these modern consonants are combinations of simple sounds.
These combinations are most probably evolved from groupings,
and are therefore modern constructions.

The number of consonants has probably increased with time.
We can choose any number from 10 to 20 or so,
with the reasonable assurance
that at some point in time humans could only profer that number of words.
A value of 12 seems certainly achievable.
We will use the symbol 𝛫 (math Kappa) to represent a single consonant.

There must have been a definite advantage for hominins that can combine simple meanings
into one coherent whole,
as compared with those that could only emit separate sounds.
Group coordination become possible without having to see each other.
Still, it is hard to see how a language of this kind could work.
In the appendix we have an example of a single-consonant language.

At which point in time did this era start?
Being so far back in time it is not easy to pinpoint.
The advantage of group coordination would definitely have been greater
when hominins started to hunt in groups,
which may have been
[around two million years ago](http://www.nature.com/news/homo-erectus-footprints-hint-at-ancient-hunting-party-1.17346).
But even such a simple language would also have been useful in foraging.
An educated guess might thus be that a million years ago
(i.e. during the reign of _Homo Erectus_)
hominins could profer single consonants and combine them into simple sentences.

### The Monosyllabic Era

At some point early humans must have learned to combine several sounds
into one syllable.
This great advance extends the range of possible words at least by an order of magnitude.
Considering the simplest structure of two consonants,
the number of words would be the square of the number of consonants.

Some kind of vowel must link the two consonants together,
to mark syllable boundaries and
to distinguish a syllable from two single consonants.
It can be a schwa or a non-grammatical vowel.
We will use the symbol ∅ (empty set) to represent a vocalic separator.
A syllable in a monosyllabic language can be either
𝛫∅𝛫 or 𝛫.
Such a language might preserve the original one-consonant functions words 𝛫,
adding 144 content words combining two consonants: 𝛫∅𝛫.
12 consonants would thus yield 144 + 12 = 156 combinations.

What brought forward this advance?
Calling syllables an _invention_ may very well misleading:
it is very likely that both proferring and parsing syllables require adaptations in the brain.

The monosyllabic era is still alive and well in many languages.


Our reasonable guess for the monosyllabic era is that
it overlapped largely with the emergence of _Homo Sapiens_,
with only minute differences between African and Neanderthal variations.

It is very tempting to imagine how different populations
geographically separated
might communicate between them.

### Vowels

Consonants cannot properly exist until vowels become
first-class citizens.

With vowels the number of possible syllables grows a bit.
A proper vowel is represented by the symbol 𝛢 (math Alpha).
Let us suppose that there are three possible vowels.
The number of combinations is now:
consonant + vowel + consonant, or 𝛫𝛢𝛫, with 432 combinations,
plus the original 12 single-consonant function words 𝛫,
for a total of 444 combinations.

The appearance of vowels may have happened several times throughout prehistory.
Many of the first written languages only wrote consonants (?).
But almost all languages in the world have vowels,
so that we can infer that their appearance happened before the last diaspora
around 50k years ago.

How do languages without vowels work?
The
[rhotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English)
pronunciation of English omits vowels in many words.
[Nuxalk or Bella Coola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxalk_language)
is an example of a modern language without vowels;
you can
[hear a sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFnrp-cUTLQ).

From our modern perspective,
not having vowels does not mean that all consonants are stuck together
in an unpronunceable blob.
It just means that vowels are not part of the language.
They may be automatically assigned by prosodic rules,
and therefore carry no meaning themselves.
Or they may be assigned randomly,
which would mean that the variants
_ta_, _ti_ or _tu_ are in fact the same word.
It is also possible that speakers use always a single neutral vowel.

[Indo-European ablaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut)
[Vowel apophony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophony)

Tracing the appearance of vowels in all languages
is again a hard issue.
At what point in prehistory did this happen?
The basic problem of a monosyllabic language is how to cram
a large number of words into a single syllable.
There are many possible variations, that can often be seen in modern use:

* Increase the number of consonants.
* Add clicks.
[Khoisan click languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoisan_languages)
([sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6WO5XabD-s)).
* Add different tones, as in
[tonal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics))
such as [Bantu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages)
([sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXAnrqkt_yM))
* Add different contours, as in Chinese
([sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkMbSWwS3FA)).
* Combine multiple syllables into words,
as in most languages in the world.

The fact that all of these mechanisms are so different
are a testimony that they must have been developed separately.
This is only possible if they happened after _Homo Sapiens_ left Africa,
around 50,000 ~ 100,000 years ago.
After that point these mechanisms developed regionally:
tonal languages in Africa,
contours in Southern Asia,
syllables in Europe,
and so on.

We can therefore conclude that all languages were monosyllabic
at least until 100,000 years ago.

García Calvo notes that Proto-Indoeuropean
(PIE) already has vowels,
while its archaic ancestor (called here AIE for short) didn't.
Keep in mind that PIE is already a modern language
with suffixes, pronouns and conjugation.
It was supposedly spoken around 7000 years ago,
which is very close to historic times in many places of the world.
A guess about rate of language change would perhaps allow dating
AIE.

### Polysyllabic Words

An immediate extension of two consonant words are three consonant words.

Arab and other semitic languages have
[triliteral roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_root)
consisting of three consonants.
It looks like a straightforward extension
of the two-consonant syllables seen above.

A language with 12 consonants and three vowels
combinations of up to three consonants
would have 1728 words of the form 𝛫∅𝛫∅𝛫,
which added to 144 𝛫∅𝛫 and 12 𝛫 yield a total of 1884 words.
Again we gain an order of magnitude over monosyllabic words.

At what point did polysyllabic words arise?
[Agmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_root#CITEREFAgmon2010)
appearance right before the Neolithic.

[Chinese not monosyllabic](http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/east_asian_languages.html#monosyllabic).

## Alternative Timelines

There are a number of possible objections
that can be raised about this timeline.

### Recent Origin

Many scholars support a much later date for the appearance of language,
[around 100,000 years ago](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701805/).
It is known that
[Neanderthals had a similar hyoid bone to ours](https://phys.org/news/2013-12-hyoid-bone-analysis-hypothesis-complex.html),
which is probably enough to discard this timeline:
this curious bone is used in speech for articulation.

### Earlier Monosyllabic Era

Our estimation for the monosyllabic era
is from 200k to 100k years ago,
due to the divergence of schemes to extend it
across the world.

There is a small problem with these dates.
When _Homo Sapiens_ left Africa,
there was already a large population of Neanderthals
occupying Europe and Asia.
So it is reasonable to think that these same Neanderthals
might have their own languages,
which influenced the newcomers.

Neanderthals are usually classified as a distinct species from _Homo Sapiens_,
even if there is now ample evidence that both groups could and did interbred.
They should thus be classified as two different subspecies inside _Homo Sapiens_,
as many scientists have advocated for decades.

It has been proposed that languages in North America and Siberia
[share a common ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den%C3%A9%E2%80%93Yeniseian_languages);
the separation happened 15,000 years ago.

### Earlier Introduction Of Vowels

The choice of early words consisting of two consonants
may seem arbitrary.
It is very well possible that vowels were introduced earlier,
perhaps with the first syllables.
Words might consist of one consonant plus one vowel;
just adding three vowels to a 12-consonant language
would extend the number of words from 12 to 36.
Words consisting of consonant + vowel + consonant
would increase the number of possibilities to 432.

But there is some evidence supporting the late appearance of vowels.
García Calvo makes the argument that prehistoric Indo-European
in its earliest incarnation had no vowels:
just non-content words with a single consonant,
and content words consisting of two juxtaposed consonants.

## Sources Of Evidence

Language does not fossilize.
This sad fact means that all of our knowledge
about how language evolved before the invention of writing
are pure speculation.
Or is it?

There are several sources of evidence about prehistoric languages.

### Physical Remains

There are the mysterious dots in prehistoric paintings
that nobody has been able to decode.
Do they represent concepts of some kind,
or are they just pretty arrangements?

### Language Reconstruction

Indoeuropean is the most famous and studied archaic language.

Rate of linguistic change is hard to estimate.
In historical times languages have varied 
[Nettle](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.500.4848&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
argues that languages change faster in small populations.
Here we argue exactly the opposite view:
that languages with few speakers evolve slowly.

### Genetics

There are many genes responsible for speech.
[?]()
[FOXP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2).
It is likely that we will be able to trace evolution of speech
by following how these genes have evolved.

Another important area of study is speech disorders.
The best way to learn how a machine works is often watching how it malfunctions.
Similarly, it is now possible to study how defects in individual genes
affect individuals that carry them.
So if gene that enables syllabic speech can be identified,
it will be possible to study how people without it
(or with a non-functional variant) communicate.
[A family](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42734/pdf/pnas01481-0291.pdf).

Genetics may thus serve as empirical proof of the timeline
that has been sketched in this article.

## Appendix: Single-Consonant Language

It becomes much easier to visualize a language type with an example.
We will call this hypothetical primitive language 'Singlecon'.

### Vocabulary

In Singlecon we only have 12 words:

* one preposition: 'to',
* one negation: 'no',
* two non-numeral quantifiers: 'much' and 'little',
* two numerals that double as pronouns: 'one' (or 'me') and 'two' (or 'you'),
* and six adverbs: 'down', 'up', 'here', 'near', 'out' and 'far'.

Note that the language consists only of function words.
There are no content words: nouns, verbs or adjectives.

### Samples

A few sentences in Singlecon follow.
They show the value of combining words for a group of foragers or hunters.

* 'one here. two out.'
The speaker will remain here while the listener goes away.
* 'one to. two here.'
The speaker will go to the objective;
the listener must stay here.
* 'much up. little here.'
There is a large quantity of what the speaker is seeking going up,
while there is little to be found here.
* 'near down.'
The objective is near but they need to go down.
* 'much much.'
There is a lot of what the speaker is seeking.

### Grammar

Even with such a simple language a grammar would be needed,
to convey different meanings depending on the combination.
For instance, 'near much' would mean that the objective is very near,
while 'much near' would mean that there is a lot of what the speaker is seeking nearby.
