The lack of modern speculation about prehistoric language is surprising,
given how much interest there is both academia and the general public
about other aspects of prehistoric life.
In this article we will explore how language originated and developed
from beyond the mysts of time.

## Sources Of Evidence

about how language evolved before the invention of writing
are pure speculation.

that nobody has been able to decode.
Do they represent concepts of some kind,
or are they just pretty arrangements?

### Language Reconstruction
