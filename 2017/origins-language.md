The lack of modern speculation about prehistoric language is surprising,
given how much interest there is both academia and the general public
about other aspects of prehistoric life.
The lack of direct evidence in these unimaginative times
is the most probable reason.
But there is an indirect approach that combines
language reconstruction and information theory
to arrive at a consistent evolution.

In this article we will explore how language originated and developed
in prehistoric times.
From beyond the mysts of time we will try to make reasoned conjectures.

## The Eras Of Language

It is not reasonable to expect that language appeared at some point in the past,
perfectly formed with all the elements that it has today.
Even partial language reconstructions such as the enlightening work done with Indoeuropean
shows that many elements are recent additions.

### Historical Evolution

Furthermore, in historic times there have been significant improvements.
Subordinate sentences were pretty new to Herodotus,
who wrote endless sentences and often forgot to finish them
(technically: [anacoluthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacoluthon)).

### Number Of Words

A very basic criteria of a language era must be
how many different words can be uttered.

## A Timeline Proposal

With this data in mind we can create the following timeline.

### Individual Sounds

Our most remote ancestors must have communicated using sounds.
Many animals use distinct vocal utterances to express different meanings.
Elements include: pitch, volume and articulation
(the shape of the mouth to generate the sound).

At this point we cannot yet speak about words,
since there is no language system.

### Single Consonants

The first organization of language must have involved single consonants.

The problem of single consonants is that there are not many of them.
Modern languages can have as much as
87 consonants for [Taa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taa_language),
about 80 for
[Ubykh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubykh_language).
A single consonant word is thus limited to less than 100 words
in the best of cases,
and probably no further than 30 or so,
since many of these modern consonants are combinations of simple sounds.
These combinations are most probably evolved from groupings,
and are therefore modern constructions.

The number of simple, distinct sounds that can be uttered separately,
without combining with others and without significant mixing,
is limited.

### The Syllabic Era

At some point early humans must have learned to combine several sounds
into one syllable.
This great invention extends the range of possible words at least by an order of magnitude.

At what point in history did this happen?

What brought forward this advance?
Calling syllables an _invention_ may very well misleading:
it is very likely that syllables require adaptations in the brain.

The syllabic era is still alive and well in many languages.

The basic problem of a monosyllabic language is how to cram
a large number of words into a single syllable.
There are many possible variations, that can often be seen in modern use:

* Add vowels.
* Increase the number of consonants.
* Add clicks.
[Khoisan click languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoisan_languages)
([sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6WO5XabD-s)).
* Add different tones, as in
[tonal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics))
such as [Bantu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages)
([sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXAnrqkt_yM))
* Add different contours, as in Chinese
([sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkMbSWwS3FA)).
* Combine multiple syllables into words,
as in most languages in the world.

The fact that all of these mechanisms are so different
are a testimony that they must have been developed separately.
This is only possible if they happened after _Homo Sapiens_ left Africa,
around 50,000 ~ 100,000 years ago.
After that point these mechanisms developed regionally:
tonal languages in Africa,
contours in Southern Asia
and so on.

We can therefore conclude that all languages were monosyllabic
until no later than 100,000 years ago.

There is a small problem with this date.
When _Homo Sapiens_ left Africa,
there was already a large population of Neanderthals
occupying Europe and Asia.

Neanderthals are usually classified as a distinct species from _Homo Sapiens_,
even if there is now ample evidence that both groups could interbreed.
They should thus be classified as two different subspecies inside _Homo Sapiens_,
as many scientists have advocated for decades.

So it is reasonable to think that these same Neanderthals
might have their own languages,
which influenced the newcomers.
It has been proposed that languages in North America and Siberia
[share a common ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den%C3%A9%E2%80%93Yeniseian_languages);
the separation happened 15,000 years ago.

### Vowels

Consonants cannot properly exist until vowels become
first-class citizens.

The invention of vowels may have happened several times throughout prehistory.
Many of the first written languages only wrote consonants (?).

The
[rhotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English)
pronunciation of English omits vowels in many words.
[Nuxalk or Bella Coola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxalk_language)
is an example of a modern language without vowels;
you can
[hear a sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFnrp-cUTLQ).

From our modern perspective,
not having vowels does not mean that all consonants are stuck together
in an unpronunceable blob.
It just means that vowels are not part of the language.
They may be automatically assigned by prosodic rules,
and therefore carry no meaning themselves.
Or they may be assigned randomly,
which would mean that the variants
_ta_, _ti_ or _tu_ are in fact the same word.
It is also possible that speakers use always a single neutral vowel.

### Polysyllabic Words

From the moment that languages have vowels

Arab and other semitic languages have
[triliteral roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_root)
consisting of three consonants.

## Alternative Timelines

### Recent Origin

Many scholars support a much later date for the appearance of language,
[around 100,000 years ago](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701805/).
It is known that
[Neanderthals had a similar hyoid bone to ours](https://phys.org/news/2013-12-hyoid-bone-analysis-hypothesis-complex.html),
which is probably enough to discard this timeline:
this curious bone is used in speech for articulation.

## Sources Of Evidence

Language does not fossilize.
This sad fact means that all of our knowledge
about how language evolved before the invention of writing
are pure speculation.
Or is it?

There are several sources of evidence about prehistoric languages.

### Physical Remains

There are the mysterious dots in prehistoric paintings
that nobody has been able to decode.
Do they represent concepts of some kind,
or are they just pretty arrangements?

### Language Reconstruction

Indoeuropean is the most famous and studied archaic language.

### Genetics

There are many genes responsible for speech.
[?]()
It is likely that we will be able to trace evolution of speech
by following how these genes have evolved.

Another important area of study is speech disorders.
The best way to learn how a machine works is by studying its failure modes.
Similarly, it is now possible to study how defects in individual genes
affect individuals that carry them.
So if gene that enables syllabic speech can be identified,
it will be possible to study how people without it
(or with a non-functional variant) communicate.

Genetics may thus serve as empirical proof of the timeline
that has been sketched in this article.
