<p>Code reviews are fine: you post your changes somewhere visible (e.g. on a GitHub pull request) so other devs in the team can review it and make comments. But, what happens when there is an unsurmountable mountain of changes?</p>
<p>Witness this Twitter joke: in <span class="citation" data-cites="Obdurodon">[Typical several-thousand-line-patch, by @Obdurodon]</span>(https://twitter.com/Obdurodon/status/651740765522161664), three people look at us from a mountain of trash.</p>

<p>The motivation for a walkthrough.</p>
<p>If you feel that you have left a lot out of the pull request description, maybe it is a good time for a code walkthrough.</p>
<p>A pull request is not</p>

<p>Gather around the fire, get cozy and start telling your story.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-requirements">The Technical Requirements</h3>
<p>In formal code reviews in the 70s, groups of devs took a printout of the code to a room and reviewed every single page. Nowadays, any conferencing tool with screen-sharing capabilities will do: Skype, Hangouts or similar. It is actually possible to do an audio-only walkthrough; calling out file name and line is not comfortable, but it can be done.</p>
<p>As to the tools used to look at the code, GitHub has an excellent interface to</p>
<h3 id="who-should-come">Who Should Come</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_walkthrough#Objectives_and_participants">formal code walkthroughs</a> there's the author, the walkthrough leader and a recorder who takes note of everything. Informally, usually the author may take on the two other roles since they will be the ones repairing any defects found.</p>
<h3 id="impersonal-evaluation">Impersonal Evaluation</h3>
<p>As with any code review, all comments should be impartial and objective.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-expect">What You Should Expect</h2>
<p>In a typical walkthrough, the author of the code should find a few issues just by explaining the changes to someone else. If you have not found a single issue with your code.</p>
<h3 id="the-aftermath">The Aftermath</h3>
<p>After the code walkthrough, the code review should continue as usual: comments.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>When a code review is not enough, just take a couple of members of the team and explain your code going through the changes.</p>
