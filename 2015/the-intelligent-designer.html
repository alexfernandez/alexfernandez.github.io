<p>Proponents of intelligent design think that the world did not arise by a random process, but by a specific design</p>
<p>Note: my own views should not be important for the purposes of this article. Yet for the curious, you will find them in part III.</p>
<h1 id="part-i-the-theory">Part I: The Theory</h1>
<p>In this first part we will look into the theory of intelligent design.</p>
<h2 id="words">Words</h2>
<p>Let us first see what those two words mean separately and then together.</p>
<p>The word <em>design</em> comes from Latin <em>designo</em>, with the meaning of &quot;mark&quot;. Its meaning is &quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;finality&quot;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>intelligence</em> comes from also from Latin, in this case from <em>intelligere</em>: &quot;understand&quot;.</p>
<p>Together both words make for an interesting combination: &quot;intelligent design&quot; thus mixes understanding and finality.</p>
<h2 id="intelligent-design">Intelligent Design</h2>
<p>This theory is usually proposed as an alternative to evolution, to explain how species evolved with the ultimate finality of creating humankind.</p>
<p>But, how intelligent is this design?</p>
<h3 id="design-flaws">Design Flaws</h3>
<p>There is an obvious problem with supposing that the design of humankind was intelligent: we are full of</p>
<p>If we look at the human body, <a href="../2013/human-body-engineered-system.html">the human body</a>, at first sight there are multiple design flaws that can prove fatal.</p>
<p>But it is too easy to criticise someone else's designs without knowing all the details. The appendix was supposed for a long time to be a useless leftover from earlier times, but has recently been shown to protect against infections by <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21153898/">housing &quot;good bacteria&quot;</a>.</p>
<h3 id="systems-design">Systems Design</h3>
<p>There are two different ways to go about when designing a system: top down and bottom up.</p>
<p>We already evaluated <a href="../2013/human-body-engineered-system.html">the human body</a> in a previous article. After looking at how it is divided in subsystems, there was no evidence of classic design in any of those.</p>
<h1 id="part-ii-the-designer">Part II: The Designer</h1>
<p>The unspoken truth about intelligent design is that there must be an agent behind this design. And who could it be?</p>
<h2 id="designer-god">Designer God</h2>
<p>Once we posit that God itself had an ulterior design for all living species, which was to create Humanity, what is the advantage to classic theology where God created Man in his likeness? Cannot God do as it pleases? The idea seems to be that, instead of just creating things magically, God devised a process that would ultimately yield an intelligent species.</p>
<p>This &quot;designer God&quot; seems much more intelligent than the usual mythological being that just creates what it sees fit. Also, the idea is cleverer, and more palatable to a modern thinker.</p>
<h1 id="part-iii-evaluation">Part III: Evaluation</h1>
<p>This section contains a critical evaluation of the hypothesis of intelligent design.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-designer">About the Designer</h2>
<p>A top-down designer seems to be out of the question, since its creations do not exhibit any .</p>
