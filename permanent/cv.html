</div>
<p>A few months ago I deleted my LinkedIn account, after the disgraceful password leak and the Microsoft buyout. In its place I have collected my professional experience in this page. Instead of just listing months and positions I will try to narrate my story. Thus the unconventional &quot;from past to present&quot; structure. It is a bit longer but far more entertaining, I hope.</p>
<h2 id="job-history">Job History</h2>
<p>I have 20 years of professional experience related to software development. Bear with me while we go over them.</p>
<h3 id="to-1998-intern-at-plataforma-solar-de-almería">1996 to 1998: Intern at Plataforma Solar de Almería</h3>
<p>My first job was to rewrite the PSA website in something that allowed for some degree of automation. A large part of it was laying out their annual report. I learned HTML in anger, and a long-forgotten environment called Frontier.</p>
<h3 id="to-2000-05-analyst-programmer-at-informática-el-corte-inglés-sa">1998-08 to 2000-05: Analyst-Programmer at Informática El Corte Inglés, SA</h3>
<p>After many years programming as a hobby I thought I knew everything about writing software. My first programming job was very useful to teach me that I was in fact wrong. I was in the team that wrote a C cash register program, with a nifty Visual Basic interface.</p>
<p>My best experience there was a two-week course taught by a real engineer: an ex-IBM manager called Kyle Rone that had worked in the Space Shuttle software. His charts and graphs made me fall in love with metrics and testing.</p>
<h3 id="to-2001-07-analyst-at-siatcom-sa">2000-05 to 2001-07: Analyst at Siatcom, SA</h3>
<p>During my first months at Siatcom I got to learn Java, then in great demand in the sector. Shortly thereafter I got to know first-hand the pitiful Spanish meat market for tech workers. I got to use my new Java skills at Telefónica I+D as a &quot;consultant&quot;, in reality a subcontractor. But then I got to participate in a couple of cool projects: a location experiment that got the user position from a mesh of mobile stations, and a WAP ringtone and messaging platform. OK, the second project was not really cool, so I left.</p>
<h3 id="to-2005-03-analyst-at-ibermática-sa">2001-08 to 2005-03: Analyst at Ibermática, SA</h3>
<p>In the Applied Research department we did many innovative things with Java and XSL, such as an agent platform (where I dealt very interesting synchronization issues) and an XSL library to generate recursive documents. I was also technical lead for InfoCitizen, an European project for sharing personal documentation across Europe.</p>
<p>It was cool to cooperate with several companies and institutions from all over Europe. As part of my job I attended several conferences and even presented a couple of European projects in academic circles. I also got to travel a lot which was nice for a while. Then it gets tiring.</p>
<h3 id="to-2007-02-consultant-at-matchmind">2005-03 to 2007-02: Consultant at Matchmind</h3>
<p>I was subcontracted out to ISBAN, part of Banco Santander. There I was part of the team that created BankSphere, a much-maligned tool for task automation. Creating it was lots of fun though: it was a series of Eclipse plugins wrote in Java, which allowed users to write JavaScript components. In retrospect it was quite advanced for its time, although I stayed clear of the JavaScript parts.</p>
<h3 id="to-2011-08-project-manager-at-ing-direct-spain">2007-07 to 2011-08: Project Manager at ING Direct Spain</h3>
<p>I was hired as an analyst, coordinating a group of 3 to 10 developers. For the last couple of years I was a project manager, and technical lead for financial cards. During my four years there I learned to communicate with non-technical parties, and to coordinate disparate teams for a common goal.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I sorely missed technical work, so at the first opportunity I went back to hard-core software development in anger.</p>
<h3 id="to-2012-08-cto-at-moveinblue">2011-08 to 2012-08: CTO at MoveinBlue</h3>
<p>I have written elsewhere at length about <a href="../2016/mib-five-years-later.html">my experience as CTO</a> so I will not repeat everything. Suffice to say that I learned PHP and had my first heavy-duty contact with JavaScript, learning to love both despite their quirks. Also, I managed a team of 3 to 5 people building an amazing product that ultimately failed to find its market, and had a great time working with great people.</p>
<h3 id="to-2012-12-freelancer">2012-08 to 2012-12: Freelancer</h3>
<p>After the adventure was mostly over, and we had failed to get rich in the process, I worked as a freelancer for Kimia writing a PHP backend and an Android app, while my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tufosa">Diego Lafuente</a> wrote the iOS version.</p>
<p>I have not stopped taking freelance engagements, since they help me stay sharp and learn new things. In fact I have worked for several large companies, here is <a href="../2016/stridercd.html">one interesting story</a></p>
<h3 id="to-present-mediasmart-mobile">2013-01 to Present: MediaSmart Mobile</h3>
<p>Since the start of 2013 I work full time for <a href="http://mediasmart.es/">MediaSmart Mobile</a>. At the time they were facing an amazing challenge of scalability and I could not reject the offer. In fact we have grown from processing two thousand requests per second to more than 300 thousand in little more than three years.</p>
<p>I work with a great team, and we are doing great things together. When I joined I thought I knew some Node.js, and I have to say that I was a bit optimistic. Since then we have tortured the V8 engine in ways that I did not even dream back then.</p>
<p>I have also learned a bit of Erlang and Go, which we use for certain subsystems. My Erlang code is not in production, while my Go code is. Those two facts say a lot more about me than about Erlang or Go.</p>
<p>My job includes math puzzles and lots of equations, and we handle huge amounts of data, so I guess I could say that I do &quot;Big Data&quot;. But, as befits a small startup, I also do lots of other things such as backend development and DevOps.</p>
<p>I am telecommuting full time and with flexible hours, which allows me to take care of my daughter when needed and at the same time use my most productive hours working, or take care of a crisis at ungodly hours. It is a win-win situation!</p>
<h2 id="volunteer-work">Volunteer Work</h2>
<p>Paid work is not everything; often it is more rewarding (and fun!) to give away your time.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</h3>
<p>My projects can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/">GitHub account</a>. The most popular at 541 stars is <a href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest">loadtest</a>, a library for load testing web applications.</p>
<p>I was a volunteer admin project at Savannah (part of the GNU project) from 2008 to 2010.</p>
<h3 id="public-speaking">Public Speaking</h3>
<p>In 2013 I started doing public talks, the very first to a crowded room for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/105582592/">MadridJS</a>.</p>
<p>I also give <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/pinchito/sessions/">talks</a> every once in a while. I consider them to be volunteer work since I am not paid, although I get to attend amazing conferences and meet interesting people.</p>
<h3 id="organizations">Organizations</h3>
<p>Since 2015 I am the organizer of MadridJS, following on the steps of the previous team which did a great job. I am also the organizer of Node.js Madrid. We have run a couple of editions of <a href="http://nodeschool.io/madrid/">NodeSchool</a>.</p>
<p>I have collaborated in the organization of two editions of <a href="http://jsday.es/">JSDayES</a>, which have been very well received by the JS communities in Spain.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I learned programming when I was 10, even before I had a computer: I wrote my Spectrum BASIC programs on paper and run to the house of a friend who had a Spectrum to write and run them. When I got my own Amstrad CPC 6128 I wrote a lot of programs in the included BASIC interpreter, and even some using Z80 assembler.</p>
<h3 id="university">University</h3>
<p>I loved computers and I loved science, so when I studied Physics, with the idea that I could learn computers on my own but self-taught science would be much harder. I was more or less right. From 1989 to 1993 I studied in Granada, and then moved to the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid to finish the last two years. It would have been nice to follow the program set by Wheeler to rewrite all of Physics using information theory, or <a href="http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_wheeler.html">&quot;it from bit&quot;</a>. But alas, it was not to be.</p>
<p>Instead I graduated in February 1996 and life led me elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="more-programming">More Programming</h3>
<p>My trusty Atari 1040ST had been with me during University, and I had used it to do lots of amazing graphs and papers using GFA Basic and a desktop publishing system called Calamus. I also learned 68000 assembler, which is a great experience when you want to optimize a program to its last consequences. But it was already feeling its age in 1996. So I got hold of an amazing Apple PowerMac 7500, and used to learn Pascal, Perl and C. I even got to learn a bit of C++ and Objective-C (back when it was not fashionable).</p>
<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
<p>The next step was to teach young talent, something I have been doing since 2000 when I was sent to Morocco to train new programmers.</p>
<p>I have participated in several editions of <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/">IronHack</a>, and in two web bootcamps (2014 and 2015) I was responsible for the JavaScript week.</p>
<p>I have also recorded several online courses, and taught a few face-to-face courses too.</p>
