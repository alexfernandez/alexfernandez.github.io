                    <p>After many years at consulting companies, joining a ‚Äúclient‚Äù was a breakthrough. I was hired as an analyst, coordinating a group of 3 to 10 developers. For the last couple of years I was a project manager and technical lead for financial cards. During my four years there I learned to communicate with non-technical parties, and to coordinate disparate teams for a common goal.</p>
                    <p>We did many interesting projects, such as leading a task force to optimize financial transactions.</p>

                    <p>I joined a medium-sized IT consulting company. I was contracted out to ISBAN, back then a subsidiary of Banco Santander. There I was part of the team that developed BankSphere, an internal tool for task automation. It was a series of Eclipse plugins wrote in Java, which allowed users to write JavaScript components. It was quite advanced for its time, and creating it was lots of fun.</p>
                    <p>During the last few months at Matchmind I worked for Leroy Merlin.</p>
                    <h3 id="to-2005-03-analyst-at-iberm√°tica-sa">2001-08 to 2005-03: Analyst at Iberm√°tica, SA</h3>
                    <p>In the Applied Research department we did many innovative things with Java and XSL, such as an agent platform dealing with very interesting thread synchronization issues, or an XSL library to generate recursive documents. I was also technical lead for InfoCitizen, an European project for sharing personal documentation across Europe.</p>
                    <p>As part of my job I attended several conferences and presented a couple of European projects in academic circles.</p>
                    <h3 id="to-2001-07-analyst-at-siatcom-sa">2000-05 to 2001-07: Analyst at Siatcom, SA</h3>
                    <p>During my first months at Siatcom I got to learn Java, then in great demand in the sector. I got to use my new Java skills at Telef√≥nica I+D as a contractor. I got to participate in a couple of cool projects: a location experiment that got the user position from a mesh of mobile stations, and a WAP ringtone and messaging platform.</p>
                    <h3 id="to-2000-05-analyst-programmer-at-inform√°tica-el-corte-ingl√©s-sa">1998-08 to 2000-05: Analyst-Programmer at Inform√°tica El Corte Ingl√©s, SA</h3>
                    <p>I was in the team that wrote a C cash register program, with a nifty Visual Basic interface.</p>
                    <p>I had the luck of participating in a two-week course taught by a real engineer: an ex-IBM manager that had worked in the Space Shuttle software. I fell in love with metrics and testing. My most interesting project was designing and writing a custom plug-in architecture from scratch.</p>
                    <h3 id="to-1998-intern-at-plataforma-solar-de-almer√≠a">1996 to 1998: Intern at Plataforma Solar de Almer√≠a</h3>
                    <p>My first job ever was to rewrite the PSA website in something that allowed for some degree of automation. A large part of it was laying out their annual report. I learned HTML and a long-forgotten environment called Frontier.</p>
                    <h2 id="volunteer-work">Volunteer Work</h2>
                    <p>Paid work is not everything.</p>
                    <h3 id="open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</h3>
                    <p>My projects can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/">GitHub account</a>. The most popular at 1.8k stars is <a href="https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest">loadtest</a>, a Node.js library for load testing web applications.</p>
                    <p>I was a volunteer admin project at Savannah (part of the GNU project) from 2008 to 2010.</p>
                    <h3 id="public-speaking">Public Speaking</h3>
                    <p>In 2013 I started doing public talks, the very first to a crowded room for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/105582592/">MadridJS</a>.</p>
                    <p>I like to give <a href="/permanent/speaker">public talks</a> every once in a while. I get to attend amazing conferences. They are excellent opportunities to learn how to speak in public and meet interesting people.</p>
                    <p>I also give talks at private events from time to time. If you would like to have a seasoned tech speaker just <a href="#Contact">contact</a> me!</p>
                    <h3 id="organizations">Organizations</h3>
                    <p>I have helped organize three editions of <a href="http://jsday.es/">JSDayES</a>, which have been very well received by the JS communities in Spain. The last edition <a href="http://2017.jsday.es/">JSDayES 2017</a> had about 600 attendees and featured 35 speakers from over 10 countries.</p>
                    <p>From 2015 to 2019 I was the main organizer of MadridJS, following on the steps of the previous team who did a great job. I am also the organizer of Node.js Madrid. We have run a couple of editions of <a href="http://nodeschool.io/madrid/">NodeSchool</a>.</p>
                    <h3 id="adalab">AdaLab</h3>
                    <p>I have given a couple of workshops at <a href="http://adalab.es/">AdaLab</a>, a bootcamp specifically for women wanting to work in software development. It has been a great experience to see people so motivated.</p>
                    <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
                    <p>My first computer was an Amstrad CPC 6128; I learned how to program BASIC and later Z80 assembler.</p>
                    <h3 id="university">University</h3>
                    <p>I studied Physics from 1989 to 1993 in Granada, and finished the last two years at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid.</p>
                    <p>My trusty Atari 1040ST was with me during University, and I had used it to do lots of amazing graphs and papers using GFA Basic and a desktop publishing system called Calamus. I also learned 68000 assembler. Being in control of every processor cycle is lots of fun!</p>
                    <h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
                    <p>I have been teaching (and enjoying it) since 2000 when I was sent to Morocco to train new programmers for IECISA.</p>
                    <p>I have taught many face-to-face courses. Lately they have been mostly about JavaScript and Node.js, and a few workshops centered on DevOps: continuous deployment and orchestration. I have also recorded several online courses.</p>
                    <p>I have participated in several editions of <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/">IronHack</a>. I was the main JavaScript teacher for two web bootcamps (2014 and 2015).</p>
                    <h2 id="other-useful-info">Other Useful Info</h2>
                    <p>Here are some other bits you may find interesting.</p>
                    <h3 id="toolset">Toolset</h3>
                    <p>I have used many dev environments including IDEs such as NetBeans or Eclipse. For many years now I have used a minimalistic environment which consists of a Bash console and the <code>vim</code> editor. (If you use <code>nano</code> or <code>ed</code> you are allowed to question the ‚Äúminimalistic‚Äù bit.) This allows me to be as productive in a remote SSH connection as locally.</p>
                    <p>My OS of choice is Debian, and my desktop is XFCE. Ubuntu for servers is nice too, and any laptop with a Unix console can be useful.</p>
                    <p>I have programmed professionally using C, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Node.js, Python and Go. I have lots of fun learning a new language or environment.</p>
