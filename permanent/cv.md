## TL;DR

Developer turned CTO with 20+ years of experience specialized in scalability and DevOps,
invested in helping teams become top performers.

## Job History

I have 20+ years of professional experience related to software development.
Dates are in
[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
format: 2016-08 is August 2016.

### 2022-09 to present: Cofounder and CTO at Ntrde

With two German partners I have co-founded [Ntrde](https://ntrde.io/),

At this new adventure I'm currently working as CTO,
making the company grow from scratch in a very promising sector.

### 2021-01 to 2022-06: CTO at Hivency

In 2021 I joined
[Hivency](https://www.hivency.com/), an influencer marketing company,
as CTO.
I had the opportunity to lead a wonderful team of French and Spanish professionals
to create the best solution in influencer marketing worldwide.
During this time I reorganized the team to work in squads,
hired new developers,
improved internal practices and moved forward in the road to continuous deployment.

In 2021-09 Hivency was acquired by the Skeepers group based in Marseille.
I helped navigate the acquisition process and subsequent audits,
and secure a successful multi-million operation.
At Skeepers I worked for nine more months as a Director of Engineering.

During this period I have worked full time as a freelancer,
mostly doing backend development in Node.js,
and have specialized in the areas of DevOps and scalability.
Since July 2020 I have collaborated with Carlos Blé and his company
[LeanMind](https://leanmind.es/en/),
where I have learned about new practices like mob programming.

I have actually been working as a freelancer on and off since 2012.
At that time I did a few months for Kimia writing an Android app.
I have not stopped taking sporadic freelance engagements since then.
My clients include several large companies:

### 2019-04 to 2019-12: CTO at Influencity

I joined [Influencity](https://www.influencity.com/),
a company in the field of influencer marketing.
I led a team of talented developers
and helped them build their for influencer marketing
using Node.js and React.

While there I helped improve the architecture,
hired two new engineers (for a total of 6 people)
and led the team during a complete revamping of critical modules.

### 2017-10 to 2019-03: Senior Developer at Devo (Formerly Logtrust)

[Devo](https://www.devo.com/) is
a thriving Spanish company that collects huge amounts of data
and keeps it in a searchable format for our customers.
We were in the middle of an impressive international expansion.
I faced a lot of exciting technical challenges while working there
as a senior software engineer.

I worked in the data ingestion team.
Our system reached peaks of 3.5 million events per second,
which it ingested flawlessly.
I made my [first contribution to the Node.js core](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20344) while there:
a benchmark demonstrating a performance issue with TLS and short-lived connections.
Hopefully not the last!

I was telecommuting most of the time,
and going to the office one day per week.

### 2013-01 to 2017-09: Backend Lead at mediasmart.io

I worked for more than four years
at [mediasmart.io](http://mediasmart.io/),
a mobile adtech company.
Before I joined the company was facing major scalability challenges.
During my stay we grew from processing two thousand requests per second
to around a million in little more than four years.
Yes, that is right:
every second we processed a million requests,
decided which ones are useful for our customers
and responded to all of them.

I led the backend team,
and we did great things together,
successfully competing at an international level.
We have tortured the V8 engine
in ways that I could not even dream before joining.
I have also learned a bit of Erlang and Go for certain subsystems.
Some of my Go code has been in production for years without issues.

We processed huge amounts of data
and had to solve complex scalability issues.
As this was a small startup I also did lots of other things:
created a whole DevOps infrastructure,
designed the selection process,
and actively participated in the selection of everyone in the dev team.

### 2011-08 to 2012-08: CTO at MoveinBlue

I led a team of 6 people 
building an amazing product that ultimately failed to find its market.
I learned PHP and had my first heavy-duty contact with JavaScript.
I definitely had a great time working with great people.
I have written elsewhere at length about
[my first experience as CTO](/2016/mib-five-years-later).

### 2007-07 to 2011-08: Project Manager at ING Direct Spain

After many years at consulting companies,
joining a "client" was a breakthrough.
I was hired as an analyst,
coordinating a group of 3 to 10 developers.
For the last couple of years I was a project manager
and technical lead for financial cards.
During my four years there I learned to communicate with non-technical parties,
and to coordinate disparate teams for a common goal.

We did many interesting projects,
such as leading a task force to optimize financial transactions.

### 2005-03 to 2007-07: Consultant at Matchmind and Indra

I joined a medium-sized IT consulting company.
I was contracted out to ISBAN,
back then a subsidiary of Banco Santander.
There I was part of the team that developed BankSphere,
an internal tool for task automation.
It was a series of Eclipse plugins wrote in Java,
which allowed users to write JavaScript components.
It was quite advanced for its time,
and creating it was lots of fun.

During the last few months at Matchmind I worked for Leroy Merlin.

### 2001-08 to 2005-03: Analyst at Ibermática, SA

In the Applied Research department we did many innovative things with Java and XSL,
such as an agent platform dealing with very interesting thread synchronization issues,
or an XSL library to generate recursive documents.
I was also technical lead for InfoCitizen,
an European project for sharing personal documentation across Europe.

As part of my job I attended several conferences and presented a couple of European projects in academic circles.

### 2000-05 to 2001-07: Analyst at Siatcom, SA

During my first months at Siatcom I got to learn Java,
then in great demand in the sector.
I got to use my new Java skills at Telefónica I+D as a contractor.
I got to participate in a couple of cool projects:
a location experiment that got the user position
from a mesh of mobile stations,
and a WAP ringtone and messaging platform.

### 1998-08 to 2000-05: Analyst-Programmer at Informática El Corte Inglés, SA

I was in the team that wrote a C cash register program,
with a nifty Visual Basic interface.

I had the luck of participating in a two-week course taught by a real engineer:
an ex-IBM manager that had worked in the Space Shuttle software.
I fell in love with metrics and testing.
My most interesting project was designing and writing a custom plug-in architecture from scratch.

### 1996 to 1998: Intern at Plataforma Solar de Almería

My first job ever was to rewrite the PSA website in something that allowed for
some degree of automation.
A large part of it was laying out their annual report.
I learned HTML and a long-forgotten environment called Frontier.

## Volunteer Work

Paid work is not everything.

### Open Source Projects

My projects can be found in my
[GitHub account](https://github.com/alexfernandez/).
The most popular at 1.8k stars is
[loadtest](https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest),
a Node.js library for load testing web applications.

I was a volunteer admin project at Savannah (part of the GNU project)
from 2008 to 2010.

### Public Speaking

In 2013 I started doing public talks,
the very first to a crowded room for
[MadridJS](http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/105582592/).

I like to give
[public talks](/permanent/speaker)
every once in a while.
I get to attend amazing conferences.
They are excellent opportunities to learn how to speak in public
and meet interesting people.

I also give talks at private events from time to time.
If you would like to have a seasoned tech speaker
just [contact](#Contact) me!

### Organizations

I have helped organize three editions of
[JSDayES](http://jsday.es/),
which have been very well received by the JS communities in Spain.
The last edition
[JSDayES 2017](http://2017.jsday.es/)
had about 600 attendees and featured 35 speakers from over 10 countries.

From 2015 to 2019 I was the main organizer of MadridJS,
following on the steps of the previous team who did a great job.
I am also the organizer of Node.js Madrid.
We have run a couple of editions of
[NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/madrid/).

### AdaLab

I have given a couple of workshops at
[AdaLab](http://adalab.es/),
a bootcamp specifically for women wanting to work in software development.
It has been a great experience to see people so motivated.

## Education

My first computer was an Amstrad CPC 6128;
I learned how to program BASIC
and later Z80 assembler.

### University

I studied Physics from 1989 to 1993 in Granada,
and finished the last two years at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.

My trusty Atari 1040ST was with me during University,
and I had used it to do lots of amazing graphs and papers
using GFA Basic and a desktop publishing system called Calamus.
I also learned 68000 assembler.
Being in control of every processor cycle is lots of fun!

### Teaching

I have been teaching (and enjoying it)
since 2000 when I was sent to Morocco to train new programmers for IECISA.

I have taught many face-to-face courses.
Lately they have been mostly about JavaScript and Node.js,
and a few workshops centered on DevOps:
continuous deployment and orchestration.
I have also recorded several online courses.

I have participated in several editions of
[IronHack](https://www.ironhack.com/).
I was the main JavaScript teacher
for two web bootcamps (2014 and 2015).

## Other Useful Info

Here are some other bits you may find interesting.

### Toolset

I have used many dev environments including IDEs such as NetBeans or Eclipse.
For many years now I have used a minimalistic environment which consists of a Bash console
and the `vim` editor.
(If you use `nano` or `ed` you are allowed to question the "minimalistic" bit.)
This allows me to be as productive in a remote SSH connection as locally.

My OS of choice is Debian, and my desktop is XFCE.
Ubuntu for servers is nice too,
and any laptop with a Unix console can be useful.

I have programmed professionally using C, Java,
PHP, JavaScript, Node.js, Python and Go.
I have lots of fun learning a new language or environment.
