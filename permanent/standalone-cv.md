from 2008 to 2010.

### Public Speaking

In 2013 I started doing public talks,
the very first to a crowded room for
[MadridJS](http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/105582592/).

I have
[extensive experience as a public speaker](./speaker.html).
Technical conferences are excellent opportunities to keep up to date,
and giving talks is a great encouragement to study some topic and give back to the community.

### Organizations

I have helped organize three editions of
[JSDayES](http://jsday.es/),
the last one with around 600 attendees and featuring 35 speakers from over 10 countries.
