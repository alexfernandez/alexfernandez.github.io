Software architecture is a fun beast:
it is as much driven by fashion as by sane reasoning.
When client-server architectures were all the rage,
everyone wanted to change how things were built.
Not to mention architectural fads such as the Enterprise Service Bus
or Business Process Managers,
which have converted endless projects into unholy messes.

It's a fun exercise to try to gaze into these trends and find the underlying
models.
