You have found the secret lair of Alex Fernández. Congrats!

I am a developer (little) known on Twitter as [pinchito](https://twitter.com/pinchito).

I help organize two great communities: [MadridJS](http://www.meetup.com/es/madridjs/) and [Node.js Madrid](http://www.meetup.com/es/Node-js-Madrid/),
where we gather once a month and have some fun talking about nerdy stuff.
