Code reviews are fine: you post your changes somewhere visible (e.g. on a GitHub pull request) so other devs in the team can review it and make comments.
But, what happens when there is an unsurmountable mountain of changes?

Witness this Twitter joke: in [Typical several-thousand-line-patch, by @Obdurodon](https://twitter.com/Obdurodon/status/651740765522161664), three people look at us from a mountain of trash.

## Why Me?

The motivation for a walkthrough.

If you feel that you have left a lot out of the pull request description, maybe it is a good time for a code walkthrough.

A pull request is not 

## The Perfect Walkthrough

Gather around the fire, get cozy and start telling your story.

### The Technical Requirements

In formal code reviews in the 70s, groups of devs took a printout of the code to a room and reviewed every single page.
Nowadays, any conferencing tool with screen-sharing capabilities will do: Skype, Hangouts or similar.
It is actually possible to do an audio-only walkthrough; calling out file name and line is not comfortable,
but it can be done.

As to the tools used to look at the code, GitHub has an excellent interface to 

### Who Should Come

In [formal code walkthroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_walkthrough#Objectives_and_participants) there's the author, the walkthrough leader and a recorder who takes note of everything.
Informally, usually the author may take on the two other roles since they will be the ones repairing any defects found.

### Impersonal Evaluation

As with any code review, all comments should be impartial and objective.

## What You Should Expect

In a typical walkthrough, the author of the code should find a few issues just by explaining the changes to someone else.
If you have not found a single issue with your code.

### The Aftermath

After the code walkthrough, the code review should continue as usual: comments.

## TL;DR

When a code review is not enough, just take a couple of members of the team and explain your code going through the changes.
